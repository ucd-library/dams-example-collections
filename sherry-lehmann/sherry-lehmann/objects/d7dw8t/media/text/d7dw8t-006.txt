i LO

n the early 1970s Chateau
Greysac was purchased by
several distinguished business-

men, including Gianni Agnelli and
Peter Kriendler of New York’s ‘‘21”
Club. This prominent group was
brought together by the late Baron
Francois de Gunzburg. Under his
direction, the Chateau was restored
to its past splendor. Vines were re-
planted and viticultural technology
was elevated to a level that prompted
the following evaluation from Robert
Parker: ‘'The style of wine at Greysac
is one that I have always found very elegant,
smooth, medium-bodied, with a complex
bouquet filled with currant fruit, and a
true, mineral, soil-like aroma.”
Chateau Greysac is now under the
able direction of Baron Francois de
Gunzburg’s widow, Mercedes. After
eight years of aging, this 1983 is
showing all the charm and elegance
described above by Mr. Parker. At
$8.95, Greysac 1983 is a low cost
passport to the greatness of the
esteemed 1983 vintage. (499)

 

From Armagnac’s Oldest House

JANNEAU
RESERVE DE LA MAISON

Today, the House of Janneau remains
the oldest producer of Armagnac.
Five generations of Janneaux, from
father to son, have succeeded Pierre
Etienne Janneau, the founder of the
firm, who built the first cellars in
1851. Armagnac Janneau is pro-
duced by the slow distillation of
white wines made ina strictly limited
area comprising the greater part of
the Gers department, and areas of
the Landes and Lot-et-Garronne in
Gascony—the home of the famous
musketeer d’Artagnan. It is reputed
that it was d’Artagnan himself who
introduced Armagnac to Parisian
society.

The Reserve de la Maison
Armagnac is made from pot stills
which impart much finesse to this
very old Brandy. When you see its
deep amber color, inhale its ethereal
bouquet and taste the elegant heritage
of Janneau’s finest Armagnac soil,
you will discover why we at Sherry-
Lehmann are so excited about this
marvelous Armagnac. (2839)
