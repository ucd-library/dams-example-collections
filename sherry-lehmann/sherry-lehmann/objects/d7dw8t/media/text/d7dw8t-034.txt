tree Rare Solera Madetras +--+

The very existence of these Madeiras is an historic wine
event. When these irreplaceable thoroughbreds have been
consumed, the opportunity to taste authentic old Solera
and vintage Madeiras of this caliber will be lost forever.

Hugh Johnson comments: What has kept Madeira alive is
the unique quality its old wines have of going on getting better and
better... This island can make the longest-lived wines in the
world. At a century old, they have concentrated their flavors into
d pungency that would be overwhelming were it not so fresh.”
