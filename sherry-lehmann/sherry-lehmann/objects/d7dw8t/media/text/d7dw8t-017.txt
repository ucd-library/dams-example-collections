\Y and in America. Its haunting licorice flavors comes
from the elderbush, called sambucus in Latin.

; , ambuca Romana, the famed after-dinner drink,

Romana’s Sambuca is the only Sambuca that comes
from Rome and holds the #1 spot in the hearts of all
those seeking the ultimate in Sambuca. Sambuca
Romana is a harmonious companion to coffee and
expresso. In fact, legend states that if you add three
ae beans to Sambuca Romana, good fortune will
ollow.

family member — Della Notte. Della Notte, which
means “The Night”, is a delicously different after-
dinner liqueur. This ‘black’? Sambuca is incredibly rich
and smooth. Enjoy Della Notte as you do Sambuca
Romana, savor it after dinner or splash it into your
expresso. Either Sambuca Romana or Della Notte

She Most Pleas ng and Msoful
of Champagne Gills

She Champagne —An historic, impeccable and world-
famous Champagne that has achieved the high rating of 91 ata
Wine Spectator blind tasting of various Champagnes. Serena
Sutcliffe, author of the definitive book Champagne, comments
on Clicquot’s Yellow Label Brut: That yellow label is instantly
recognizable, even when glimpsed from afar... . Itis the champagne
of nostalgia, of family reunions, Christmas parties and hesitant
debuts into an adult world....From the dynamic direction that
Clicquot is now taking, one would think that The Widow herself was
back in control.”’ Look for deep flavor, length on the palate and
ideal equilibrium of fruit and acidity. (18)

fo Fac —Large enough to accommodate a bottle of Clicquot
Yellow Label Brut Champagne, made of durable, high-polished
heavy paper bearing the Clicquot insignia, this handsome ‘‘sac’”’
easily converts to a tote bag. Its attractive black cord handle
permits you to carry the sac easily and freely. There is no
added cost for the sac, which is Clicquot’s Christmas gift to
you with each bottle of Clicquot Yellow Label Brut you
purchase.
