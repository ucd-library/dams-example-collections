The hills between Udine and Gorizia yield what are undeniably
Italy’s finest white wines. Here the Alps meet the Adriatic.
Tocai, Ribolla, Verduzzo, Malvasia and Picolit are the time
honored varietals. Largely unnoticed by the American con-
sumer, they are classic and incredibly fine, nonetheless. Red
wines of the region go even more undetected for quality yet
excellence abounds. The sheer plum-saturated finesse of Ronchi
di Cialla’s Refosco or smooth berry flavor of their Schioppetino
should not be overlooked by oenophiles.

sees Trentine-Mla- ddige tees

Much like Alsace in France, Trentino and Alto Adige lie
northernmost of all wine producing areas in Italy and share
German asa second language. Again, like Alsace, the wines here
are heady and perfumed with the whites outnumbering the
reds. Wurst and black bread are as likely to appear at the table
as pasta and polenta—so the wines of this region are made to
match a wide variety of flavors.
