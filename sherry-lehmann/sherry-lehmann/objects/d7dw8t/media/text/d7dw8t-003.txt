 

covered a remarkable 1934

vintage Armagnac of Chateau
de Laubade while visiting Bor-
deaux. At a dinner in his honor at
Chateau Rausan-Segla in Margaux,
the 1934 Chateau de Laubade
Vintage Armagnac was served, to
celebrate the historic founding
of Sherry-Lehmann in that year.
Upon sampling the ethereal
bouquet, Mr. Aaron knew that the
Armagnac of Chateau de Laubade
was extraordinary.

Soon afterward, this stunning
1934 Armagnac was imported to
Sherry-Lehmann, bearing the
name ‘Founders’ Reserve.” It
has become a tradition on subse-
quent visits to France, to add to
our treasure cellar of these vintage
Armagnacs.

Imbibe these Armagnacs and
you will be drinking history!

AMONG THE SEASON’S MOST BEAUTIFUL GIFTS

JACOPO POLI GIFT SET

ies, Grappas are uncolored and
have an unmistakable nose and
flavor. When aged, Grappas ob-
tain considerable finesse.

This Jacopo Poli Gift Set con-
sists of three 100ml bottles of
Grappa and three 100ml bottles
of Fruit Distillates (Cherry, Pear
and Peach). Producing the finest
Grappas and Fruit Distillates

100 ml bottle is harvested from
the finest grapes and fruit and is

1990 was an exceptionally fine vintage
for Chateau de la Chaize, as it was
throughout Beaujolais. The exquisite
breeding of the Brouilly of la Chaize
becomes even more gloriously evident in
this vintage renowned for the elegance of
its wines and the intriguing complexity of
their floral and fruity characteristics. You
will find marvelous subtlety to balance ;
the richness of the raspberry fruit—a ; = = :

Two Delicious 1991s from Georges Duboeuf
Arrive Just IN Time For Joyous Holiday Entertainment

BEAUJOLAIS NOUVEAU 199]

In a letter to Michael Aaron of Sherry-
Lehmann, Georges Duboeuf wrote:
“Good wine has only one master and 1991 is
the year Mother Nature kissed Beaujolais
. . . Beaujolais will be the most favored wine
region in France in 1991 . . . It is with great
pride that I send Sherry-Lehmann my Spe-
cially Selected Flower Label Beaujolais
Nouveau 1991 from my best barrels. It
flourishes with good character, excellent fruit
and rich flavours of ripe berries such as
strawberry and cherry.” (4555)

GAMAY NOUVEAUX 1991

Last year, Georges Duboeuf took his
wine making skills to the Ardeche region
of France to create a new wine—Gamay
Nouveau. It immediately won the praise
of wine critics and consumers alike. His
second release has just reached our cellars.

Gamay Nouveau 1991 is of exceptional
quality. Bing cherry fruit with aromas of
blackberries, blueberries and currants
dance on the palate. It is a very supple,
harmonious and mouth-filling—a very
quaffable red that is easy to enjoy. (5555)
