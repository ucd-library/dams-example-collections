The sweet, lush white wines of Bordeaux flourished in
1988. Rarely have we experienced the dramatic intensity
that these wines offer. Robert Parker comments:
“".. several respected European writers have already claimed
that 1988 is Sauternes’ most magnificent vintage since 1937.”

of botrytis, new oak, and honeyed oranges and melons.”

GUIRAUD (Sauternes) 78.97 467.40

dedication and sheer brillance that has made the name
“ROTHSCHILD” so dear to the hearts of Bordeaux connoisseurs.

British wine essayists often write of the greatness of the 19th-century wines
produced by the remarkable Rothschild family. We
agree with them entirely. But we also know that the
Rothschilds are not the sort of folks who rest on laurels
won by earlier generations. They learn well. They profit

H ere are five estates—each of them managed with that unique sense of

CARRUADES
DE LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD

Chateau Margaux has its Pavillon Rouge; Chateau Latour, its
Les Forts de Latour. Similarly, Chateau Lafite-Rothschild has
a “second label” called Carruades de Lafite-Rothschild. Each
year, after lengthy and exacting barrel tastings in the chaix of
Lafite-Rothschild, the wine is chosen that will bear the
precious name “‘Lafite.” The second selection—primarily
from younger vines—is called Carruades de Lafite-Rothschild.
This strict selection process allows Lafite to be as great as it
is. It also makes Carruades de Lafite one of the most
wonderful Bordeaux values imaginable. Highly
recommended for those who love Lafite, but wish to taste it
in a slightly lighter vein and at a substantially lower price.

Reserve Cognac de Chateau

We were first introuced to Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild Reserve Cognac in

September 1984, during the 50th f

Anniversary celebration of Sherry-
Lehmann in Bordeaux.

At Chateau Lafite-Rothschild we
were privileged to taste the oldest
Cognac reserves in their cellars. These
Cognacs were not commercially
available, but Michael Aaron managed
to persuade the good Baron Eric to
send a small shipment of this precious,
rare, unbelievably great Cognac to
Sherry-Lehmann. (2774)
