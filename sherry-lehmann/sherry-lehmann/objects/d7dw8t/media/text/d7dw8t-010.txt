BORDEAUX CONTINUES HOT STREAK

APRIL 30, 1991
“1990 marks another outstanding vintage for
Bordeaux .. . a string of successes unequaled in
40 years. The 1990 red wines have an impressive
harmony of ripe fruit and fine, integrated tannins.
The same wines in 1989 have an exuberance of
exciting fruit and massive tannins seldom seen in
Bordeaux.

A typical 1989 from a top estate is a
profound wine, with opulent aromas of prunes,
berries and earth and well-knit tannins... .

Our tastings show that 1990 is not far off
the mark in quality—although quite dif-
ferent in style from 1989... .

In the end, Bordeaux produced very different
wines in 1990 than in 1989. ‘The fruit was different
between the 1989 and 1990,’ said Jean Delmas,
manager of chateau Haut-Brion and La Mission
Haut-Brion, both of which produced outstanding
wines in 1989 and ’90. ‘The 1989 has more of a ripe
fruit and roasted character, while 1990 is fresher.
The 1990 is more Bordeaux in style but I prefer the
1989. It is like 1959.’....”

NOVEMBER 15, 1991

“Several days of heavy and frequent rain
just before this year’s harvest started in France
dampened vintners’ hopes to make great
wine from the 1991 vintages... .
‘When it rains for a whole week you don’t like it,’
said Corinne Mentzelopoulos of Chateau Margaux,
who said the downpour bloated the grapes.
But once the harvest got underway, it took place
under mostly clear skies and fine weather. The
Merlot grapes did better than the Cabernet
Sauvignon grapes... .”

1991 Harvest

VANITY FAL

We Quote Joel Fleishman, Wine Editor

It’s Time to Shell Out
For The Great
Late-ViNTAGE French Clarets

“It had to happen sooner or later. After a sensational
sequence of good-to-great vintages, Bordeaux was
slammed by a killer frost the night of April 20,
1991, literally nipping the grape blossoms in the bud.
The result: sparse flowers, erratic pollination, fewer
grapes. Most chateaux seem likely to make about
half of their usual volume of wine. If 1991 turns
out to be a great vintage, its prices will be as-
trospheric because of the small supply. If 91 proves
lackluster, however, the ’89s and ’90s will escalate
in price because they will be the most recent avail-
able great vintages. This is, therefore, the best time
to consider purchasing Bordeaux of the last few years.”

 

 

 

CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD

Mr. Michael Aaron October 22, 1991
Sherry-Lehmann

Dear Michael,

1 look forward to seeing you and Christine on Sunday at
The New York Wine Experience. I will not wait for this
opportunity to bring you up to date on the vendange at

Chateau Lafite-Rothschild that has just been completed.

1991 was a very complex harvest. At Lafite, we were lucky
enough to produce 35% of a normal crop. Although this
may seem extremely small to you, we are fortunate with this
meager number since other properties might produce as little
as 10% this year. I hear that some Chateaux in Pomerol
might not produce any wine at all!

But let us not despair. A small, good crop is the occasion to
look back on past years and feel thankful that those vintages
were high quality, abundant and also still available.

With all my best wishes.

To Buy Or Not To Buy?

After contacting many of the proprietors of Bor-
deaux’s famed Chateaux, it is our opinion that the
overall quality of the 1991s will be good. But, the
variation of quality between one vineyard and another
could be dramatic. It has also been established that
the quantity of the overall 1991 vintage is way below a
normal crop. It will be difficult for any Chateau to
approach the quality of the wine produced in the
1989 and 1990 vintages.

Historically, similar adverse conditions in the past,
have driven prices up on the Bordeaux market.
Therefore, our advice is to purchase the great
1989 & 1990 Bordeaux vintages now, before
the scarcity created by the 1991 harvest is felt on
the Bordeaux market next year.
