 

  

A wide variety of France’s most fascinating and reasonably
priced fine wines come from the Rhone Valley. Knowledgeable
wine-lovers are becoming increasingly aware that the Rhone
Valley’s best wines are every bit as distinguished—and reward-
ing to drink and cellar—as Bordeaux’s and Burgundy’s finest.

Robert Parker, in the introduction to his authoritative book
The Wines of the Rhone Valley and Provence, praises them

 

as “exhilarating as well as compulsive . . . the world’s most under-
rated great wines.”’

he small village of Chablis, just 110 miles
southeast of Paris, is perhaps the most famous
white wine name in the world. The very word
“Chablis” conjures up images of a crisp, dry, austere
_wine with lively acidity.

Genuine Chablis, however, is something of a
rarity. Even more emarkble are the Premier Cru
vineyards clustered around the sloping hills of
Chablis. The small Montee de Tonnerre vineyards
are considered by many wine critics to be the best of
all the Premier Crus.

Founded in 1860, the family firm of A. Regnard
et Fils specializes in producing some of the finest
Premier Crus of Chablis. This 1986 Montee de
Tonnerre is rich, full and vibrant. At only $16.95 it
represents outstanding value in fine white Burgundy.

‘We were stunned when we received the call asking us to
supply wine for the Queen’s luncheon,” states Shari
Staglin, owner of the tiny Staglin Family Vineyards in
Napa Valley.

And it’s no wonder, Staglin hadn’t even released its 1989
chardonnay for sale when the winery was approached by
organizers of a Capitol Hill luncheon with requests to serve
the wine to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, during her
recent visit to the United States. The wine was matched
with a spiced shrimp with hearts of palm and fresh tomatoes
at the luncheon, jointly hosted by bipartisan House and
Senate leaders.

“Obviously, we’re thrilled with the honor,” says Staglin.
“We've never even tried to sell our wines at retail,” she
continues, noting that limited distribution is available
through local restaurants. (7211)

The Chavy firm, founded by Jean Chavy, is one
Burgundy’s finest. Jean’s son Gerard is now at the helm

this operation. As a master vigneron, Gerard oversees every
detail of the day-to-day operation of the family’s vineyards

the two extraordinary white Burgundies listed below.

M eursault enjoys wearing many hats. The sleepy

town of Meursault boasts of being the Cote d’Or’s
most visited village next to Beaune itself. It is an area of
great political excitement around election time in the
spring, and it hosts the annual “Paulee de Meursault’
festival celebrated on the Monday after the Hospices de
Beaune sale.

But all this excitement doesn’t match that of its world
famous commodity—its white wine. Often called
“Burgundy’s most hedonistic wine,” the Meursaults
of Boillot-Buthiau are some of the most delightful of
all. Buttery, rich and quite full with apple and soft peach
flavors. (984)
