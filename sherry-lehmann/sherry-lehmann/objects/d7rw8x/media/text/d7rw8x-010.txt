BOLLINGER BRUT 1964 10.25 110.70
Madame Bollinger has kindly consented to let us have a
small quantity of her 1964 Brut reserve. Our comparative
tastings indicate that this is French Champagne at the apex
of its career—sheer perfection for drinking during the next
year or two. The price is astonishing! Simply compare the
cost of $110.70 the case to what other famous 1966 or 1964
Champagnes command. Even an elementary student of math-
ematics can perceive a saving of about $30.00 the case.
Quantity limited—suggest ordering promptly.
