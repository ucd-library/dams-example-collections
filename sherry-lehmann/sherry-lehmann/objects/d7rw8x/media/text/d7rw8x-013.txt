NEW YORK STATE

Although the wine acreage in New York State is but a fraction
of the vineyard land in California, you will find here the same
sense of challenge and dedication to excellence. The important
wine-growing areas are the Finger Lakes, the Chatauqua area
along Lake Erie, and the Hudson Valley. The most significant
development, after years of experimental work, has been the
introduction of a new family of European wine grapes known
as the French hybrids. They have exhibited the ruggedness and
excellence needed to grow wines of European character under
the hardship conditions of the cool New York State climate.
The best of them are listed below.

BOORDY VINEYARD

While Editor of the Baltimore Sun, Philip Wagner, and his wife
Jocelyn, started a vineyard at their home property in Maryland,
experimenting with European wine grapes. They succeeded to
such an extent, that, in their quest for good vineyard land, they
established additional vineyards in upper New York State.
Their wines, which we offer here, have won the plaudits of the
most skeptical wine drinkers.

DR. CONSTANTIN FRANK

We have recently visited Dr. Frank at his vineyard near Ham-
mondsport and were most impressed by his knowledge, his
complete commitment, and the astonishing excellence of his
white wines. Dr. Frank brought many of his cuttings with him
from Europe where he headed a vinicultural school.

VERMONT

Vermont cannot boast of its grapes, but it can of its ‘apples.’
In pursuit of a pre-Civil War tradition of New England, Frank
Jedlicka has dedicated himself to making the best possible
wine, using European methods, from hand-picked apples. The
result is utterly astonishing—tasted blind, many guess that it is
a good wine from Macon, with just a hint of the fruit of the
apple. It is the kind of wine that has captured New England—
andit is now available for the first time in New York State.

BULLY HILL VINEYARD

The Walter S. Taylor family have pioneered wine making in
the Finger Lakes area for over a century. The Finger Lakes
Museum is adjacent to their large plantings of superior French
hybrid varieties. Both their red and their white represent a new
trend towards excellence in New York State wines.

BENMARL VINEYARDS

Recently, accompanied by Alexis Lichine, Marquis de Roussy
de Sales, we visited the Benmarl vineyard that dramatically
overlooks the Hudson River. All of us were impressed by the
exceptional Seyval Blanc 1971 which tasted like a good dry
wine from the Loire Valley. Mark Miller, the wine maker pro-
vided us with enough evidence to indicate clearly that there
is a brilliant wine future in the Hudson Valley.

There is a vineyard only 28 miles from Columbus Circle, up
the Hudson near Haverstraw, on High Tor Mountain. Wine-
maker Voight, a man of taste, is proud of what he produces.
