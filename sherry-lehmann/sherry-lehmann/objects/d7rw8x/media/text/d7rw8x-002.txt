1969 VINTAGE

Because of half a normal production, the opening prices of the
1969 were record-breaking. Some exceptional examples have
reached our shore. Here are some outstanding values below
$4.00 a bottle from excellent vineyards of Bordeaux.

GHATEAU BELLEVUE 220 ..2.2%5... 31%; 2.79 30.15
Our 1967 ran out quickly because everyone loved this
wine and came back for more.

CHATEAU VIEUX ROBIN .............. 2.99 32.30
Chateau-bottled Medoc. Less than 50 cases remain.
CHATEAU CGOUTELIN-MERVILLE ...... 3.49 37.70
St. Estephe. Superior. Bottled by Eschenauer.
CHATEAU HANTEILLAN .............. 3.49 37.70

Fine Medoc—bottled in Bordeaux by Eschenauer. This
is the very wine that was chosen in a blind competition
tasting by AIR FRANCE to serve on their European
flights.

CHATEAU CANON DE BREM ........... 3.49 37.70
A chateau-bottled discovery from Canon-Fronsac. The
vineyards are not far from St. Emilion and they have
similar fruity characteristics—a midpoint between Médoc
and Céte d’Or.

CHATEAU MAISON BLANCHE ......... 3.79 40.95
We'll let you in on a secret—the leading wine critics of
America consistently buy this Montagne St. Emilion be-
cause of the quality and low cos.t We are inclined to
agree with them. We also know that it will cost us more
to replace this wine than what we are offering it to you
for at present.

CHATEAU DU-PARG 23) 0262.2) 20. 3.79 40.95
Attention must be paid here! Despite the exalted prices
of chateau-bottled vineyards of the Haut-Médoc, here is
a delightful example, imported by Wildman, that harkens
back to the more liveable prices of yesteryear. We can-
not replace it at this price so we suggest you buy now.
GHATEAU GREYSAG (2..22..05.5% Sse. 3.99 43.10
To be taken seriously since it is perhaps the best value
of all of the Médoc. Georges Hereil has now owned the
vineyard for over a decade and his dedication to excel-
lence reached an apex during the 1969 vintage. Drink
now as well as ten years hence—you will be delighted
en route.

CHATEAU. SIMARD. 52 328.5 3 4.79 51.75
The most popular St. Emilion of the New York French
restaurants.

CHATEAU BOUSGAUT = 23. -4.5.4. =. 6.69 72.25
We are now dealing with the first vintage produced
under the dedicated supervision of the new Managing
Director, Jean Delmas—the man who is also Managing
Director of Chateau Haut Brion. This vintage proves
clearly the up-grading that can result from care, loving
devotion, selection, and superior vinification.
GHATEAU WANGEERUS ........:....... 7.49 80.90
St. Emilion matures relatively quickly. This 1969 is ready
now—you will enjoy it today or three years hence.
CHATEAU LAFON-ROCHET ........... 8.95 96.65
One of the great ‘Grand Crus’ of St. Estephe. Long-lived,
superb, ideal for laying down.

-GHATEAU GLORIA . 25 38 8.95 96.65
The glory of St. Julien is reflected in ‘Gloria.’
CHATEAU LASCOMBES ............... 8.95 96.65

We admire Alexis Lichine and the wine that he produced
at Lascombes during the 1969 vintage. Outstanding ex-
ample of top flight Margaux.

CHATEAU PICHON LALANDE ......... 9.95 107.45
Adjacent to Chateau Latour, and similar in character-
istics. Noble example of Pauillac.

CHATEAU CALON SEGUR ............. 10.95 118.25
St. Estephe at its best. Superb.

CHATEAU GISCOURS ................. 11.75 126.90
Classic example of one of the great Growths of Margaux.
CHATEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU ..... 15.50 167.40
There are those who claim this is the best of all St.
Juliens.

CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION.. 17.95 193.85

It is said that Willie Mays can throw a baseball from the
front porch of Haut Brion and land on the vineyards of
La Mission Haut Brion. In any event, the outstanding
characteristics of great Graves are apparent here.
GHATEAUW EATOUR. ce. 5. ee 39.50 426.60
Great depth—remarkable longevity—a harmony of all
elements.

1968 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Likely to be overlooked as a vintage, but certainly the 68s are
much better than the '63s and ’65s. The great vineyards listed
below, through selection and reduction of total quantity, have
been able to provide truly excellent wines and are ideally
suited for present drinking. Here are some of the giants of
Bordeaux that can be consumed now at a price much below the
value of the intrinsic excellence you will experience. The
Latour and Petrus are priced here below the present replace-
ment cost in Bordeaux.

CHATEAU RAUSAN-SEGLA ............ 4.49 48.50
Grand Cru Margaux classified in 1855.
GHATEAU GOS D’ESTOURNEL ......... 6.49 70.10

St. Estephe. Usually this vineyard produces wines that
take a decade to mature. In a light year such as ’68 you
have a happy harmony. Ready now.

CHATEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU ..... 719 86.30
A current opinion in Bordeaux is that Ducru Beaucaillou
is now approaching the first growths in stature. We do
not know about other years, but we are inclined to agree
in 1968.

GHEREAU BEYGHEVELER....~.........:- 7.99 86.30
The integrity of this St. Julien soil expressed itself in
light, subtle and excellent fashion in 1968.

GHATEAU TAROUR 6.25.5 6. 525.8, 12.50 135.00
A Pauilac giant. Latour often reaches great heights in
unfashionable years. A ‘best buy’ for those who want to
experience the elegance of Latour at a non-staggering
price.

GHATBAU PEERUS =. 3... Ss 12.50 135.00
Chateau Petrus—the giant of Pomerol—is hard to come by
and usually commands over $30 the bottle. It was excel-
lent in 1968 and we have a few cases available at a liv-
able cost.
