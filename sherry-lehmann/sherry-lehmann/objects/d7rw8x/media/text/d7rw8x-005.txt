RED BURGUNDY (contd)
1969 VINTAGE

We again turn to the great world authority Frank Schoonmaker
and his Vintage Chart to provide some insight into the excel-
lence of the 1969 vintage among the red Burgundies: “1969 is
an exceedingly great year in Burgundy, quite in the class with
fabulous 1961... deep-colored, rich, everything that fine Bur-
gundies should be...a few conceivably even 20/20, which is
as high as I can go.” We know of no more persuasive statement
to justify anticipating your future requirements than the objec-
tive evaluation by Mr. Schoonmaker—an opinion shared unani-
mously by the Burgundy wine growers’ community.

SOLEIL NOIR (Drouhin) 3.59 38.75
In our opinion, Drouhin is among the most reliable
sources of top flight Burgundies. Despite the low cost,
his Soleil Noir is a well balanced delight with finesse,
depth, and balance. 1969 just depleted. Young, fresh,
fruity 1970 now available.

PINOT NOIR 4.49 48.50
A ‘best buy.’ Estate-bottled by Guillemard on superior
Burgundian soil. Noble Pinot Noir flavor emerges.
CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET 4.99 53.90
Although Chassagne-Montrachet is perhaps more famed
for its white wines, those who appreciate fine red Bur-
gundy have learned to recognize the virtues of the red
wines produced here. Estate-bottled, Bachelet-Ramonet.
SAVIGNY-LES-BEAUNE 5.49 59.30
Pierre Bitouzet is the wine-maker for Prince de Mérode.
He owns this vineyard and is proud of what he produces.
Excellent.

AUXEY-DURESSES ROUGE 5.99 64.70
A ‘sleeper’ from the hills behind Pommard. There is a
drinking reward economically for acquiring a less well
known great red wine. Estate-bottled, René Roy.
VOSNE-ROMANEE 7.49 80.90
Despite its small size, Vosne-Romanée is the most re-
markable and famed of the wine producing communes
of all France. Hard to come by, never inexpensive, worth
seeking out for its breed and elegance. Estate-bottled,
Domaine Mugneret.

CHAMBOLLE-MUSIGNY ................ 7.99 86.30
Charming, delicate, fragrant—-makes up in finesse what
it may lack in weight. Estate-bottled, Sigaut.

GORTON RENARDES .........:........ 11.95 129.05
Prince de Mérode is to the Cote de Beaune what Domaine
de la Romanée-Conti is to the Céte de Nuits—the best of
class. Here is Corton, his best vineyard, reaching an apex
of excellence during the 1969 vintage.

POMMARD ERENOMS °..:..2-.4....-... 12.50 135.00
A genuine Pommard from its best vineyard ‘Epenots.’
Estate-bottled by Madame Courcel—Particularly in a
great year such as 1969—reaches Pommard’s pinnacle of
excellence.

GLEOS DE VOUGEOT .........::.:=...:. 12.50 135.00
124 acres of vinous blessedness. Distinguished more for
its breed than for its power. An excellent example.
Estate-bottled by Marcel Rion.

BONNES: MARES 5... assoc Go ss a 14.95 161.45
A vineyard that enjoys the same exalted classification
in Burgundy that a ‘First Growth’ occupies in Bordeaux.
But, alas, there are only 37 acres of Bonnes Mares. In-
comparable finesse. Estate-bottled, Clair-Dau.
ROMANEE SAINT VIVANT ............. 34.25 370.00
The Domaine de la Romanée-Conti now grows and vini-
fies the great Romanée St. Vivant vineyard in coopera-
tion with the Domaine Marey-Monge. It lies adjacent to
Romanée-Conti, La Tache, and Richebourg and is en-
dowed with the same royalty.

GUIVER-BRUNEM: 3. 3.52. sa2ed «anes 12.50 135.00

vintage, commanded double this price at the auction. A
superb Beaune.

This vineyard is a narrow lane that separates Romanée-

of Burgundy. Estate-bottled, H. Lamarche.

La Romanée is a tiny vineyard adjacent to Romanée-
Conti. Less than 300 cases are produced annually and
the world seeks this wine out. Estate-bottled, Domaine

OLDER
RED BURGUNDIES

Here are a few rare survivors of famed vintage years of previ-
ous decades. Because of their small size, Burgundy growers
cannot hold on to previous vintages in the same manner that
it can be achieved in the large estates of Bordeaux. As a conse-
quence, they are hard to come by and are much appreciated
by those wine aficionados whc love fine old red Burgundy.
Here are a few remarkable examples that we are fortunate
enough to be able to offer you.

RIGHEBOURG 1963) 2... 2s ws 12.25 132.25
No wine bearing the noble name of Domaine de la
Romanée-Conti is permitted to leave the vineyard unless
it passes the supreme test of outstanding excellence.
Here is a wine, which if it bore a more fashionable vin-
tage date, would command four times the price.
WeAC WAGE: M963) 2s ee 13.95 150.65
Despite being an unfashionable year, La Tache, received
high expression in 1963 at the Domaine de la Romanée-
Conti.
BEAUNE CHAMPINOTS 1961 ........... 17.95 193.85
Joseph Drouhin has been kind to our clientele and to us.
After continuous requests on our part for some of his
1961 reserves, which we have tasted, they finally con-
sented to send us a few cases. Here is red Burgundy at
its best.
GEOS DE VOUGEOT 1961. ............: 22.50 243.00

year—a jewel in the crown of Burgundy—from the cellars
of Domaine Jaffelin.
