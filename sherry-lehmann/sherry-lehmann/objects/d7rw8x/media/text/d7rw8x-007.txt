THE COUNTRY WINES OF FRANCE

FRENCH COUNTRY WINES-Red

Despite the fact that the French franc was 23.5¢ as we went to
press, American tourist will still occupy the better hotels of
Paris and the wonderful inns, relais, and ski resorts of the
French countryside. What will they drink? In most instances,
they will enjoy the local wines that are charming and excellent
—that are still obtainable at low cost. These ‘country wines’
make no pretense to greatness—each has its own personal mes-
sage, its own charm, combining beautifully with the local food
specialties. They can still be enjoyed in America today at de-
lightfully low cost—most at well under $3.00 the bottle. These
wines are interesting and should be experienced as adventures
in wine tasting.

even have heard him in concert with his group at the
Philharmonic. Mr. Loussier loves the wines of his be-
loved France so much that he bought a vineyard in
Provence. He only produces Vin Rosé and his wine re-
flects his creativity, charm and dedication. Try it—you
