Discover one of the world’s great wine values:
the delicious Sherry-Lehmann Santiago “1541”

Pedro de Valdivia, 5 : ; :
an intrepid Spanish varietal wines from Chile. Named for the Spanish

explorer, founded explorer Pedro de Valdivia, who established a
the city of Santiago ~—- fort at what would become the city of Santiago

pees in 1541, these well-priced wines are perfect for
entertaining or everyday consumption.

History tells us of Valdivia’s arduous trek across Peru's Atacama
desert where he and his intrepid team were nearly beaten by the
elements. Battered and exhausted, they finally reached the place they
would call Santiago, certainly unaware that due south lay some of the
world’s best vineyard land.

Santiago is now Chile’s capital, of course, and the vineyards of the
Maipo Valley have distinguished themselves among the best of the
New World.

At Sherry-Lehmann, our constant search for good value, high quali-
ty wines has occasionally led us to trace the paths of explorers from
another age, but in all of our travels, we cannot remember a
Chile’s more delightful find than these delicious varietal wines
from Santiago. Discover them for yourself today.

nazing Value in Chianti!

The historic 17th century Fagnano castle sits on the estate where
the Sangiovese grapes for this elegant, well- structured wine are
grown. Owned by the Terrosi Vagnoli family, these

vineyards enjoy the microclimate _
typical of the high country around
Castelnuovo Berardenga. A
medium-bodied, elegant red with
a lively, ruby-red color and an
intensely fragrant bouquet oe : Tae
reminiscent of the scent of violets.
With age, it will develop an even
greater finesse. On the palate it

is harmonious with dry, slightly
tannic and rigorous flavors.

Among our favorite matches

for Chianti Classico Fagnano are
spaghetti alla Bolognese, grilled
porcini mushrooms, chicken
cacciatore and pizza. (7201)

ered our Maison Rouge.

the red wine that
pleases the broadest
spectrum of wine-

ing quaff. (1083)

“Sauvion’'s Cler’ Blanc,
an exclusive at Sherry-
Lehmann. Created by
Jean Sauvion...|t's dry
but very fruity, quite
light, with a slight
tingle on the palate.
Sauvion manages to
capture this clean,
lilting freshness year
after year — | guess
that's why he’s known
as the wine wizard of
the Loire...”

-Barbara Ensrud. (484)
