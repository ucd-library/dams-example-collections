Le Can-Can
A SHERRY-LEHMANN EXCLUSIVE!

The beloved Sherry-Lehmann “Le Can-Can” has an illustrious history. Just
after World War Il, the only way to travel to Europe was by steamship. By 1947, a
significant part of Sherry Wine & Spirit's business was delivering Bon Voyage gifts
to transatlantic ocean liners. This “Bon Voyage” commerce became an industry unto
itself. A simple perusal of the Yellow Pages, circa 1947-1948, would reveal an
entire section devoted to merchants who specialty was to sell “Bon Voyage Gifts.”

: Jack Aaron, founder of Sherry-Lehmann, persuaded the dockworkers to
accept deliveries of iced Champagnes. Sherry’s drivers were able to make these
iveries directly into the staterooms of avalecs well before the guests arrived.
accomplish this Jack Aaron had the unique idea of filling steel garbage cans
1pagne surrounded by ice and putting a big bow on top. The gifts
instant success!
