is aged in one-third new French
oak casks. Muscular, tannic, and
hard, with considerable austerity,

Tenuta Sette Ponti Only the second vintage release of this
wine, the ‘99 is made from a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet

Red and black fruits mingle with spicy clove on the nose,
followed by raspberry jam, chocolate and cinnamon on the
palate. Even fresher and more delineated than the 1999 bot-
tling, with superb focus and concentration. Very ripe tannins

International Wine Cellar (4108)

"PALEO" ROSSO 1997 99.95 87.95 1,055.40
Le Macchiole "Its opaque ruby/purple color is followed by

cassis. Full-bodied, with a roasted meat
character to its flavors, extraordinary puri-
ty and concentration..." -R. Parker (91246)
