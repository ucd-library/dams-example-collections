where the Cistercian monks of the Abbey of Vertheuil

established the first vines. Many years later Baron
Edmond de Rothschild bought the property and
completely renovated the cellar and vineyards.

nose lead to a full body, with good ripe
fruit and a velvety tannin structure.”

§ Every
| year
when
we
_ travel
: to
Bordeaux
to assess the most recent
vintage, in addition to sorting through
hundreds of cru classe wines, we are also
working hard to find and source hidden
gems from Bordeaux's Petits Chateaux.
These chateaux don't foster the worldwide
acclaim and hype often surrounding the
higher profile wines of the region, but
since we search carefully we find some
beautiful wines at very reasonable
prices. For many decades now, we've
prided ourselves on finding these special
wines, and as winemaking has improved
with the years, so has the quality of all
the wines of Bordeaux. The wines we list
here, our Unsung Heroes, are wines
that we've tasted and enjoyed and find to
be superb values.
