 

History In The Making!

“The combination of deliciously sweet, small, thick-skinned berries -
displaying a perfect balance of sugar and acidity - and extremely low
yields, has winemakers and producers anticipating that 2009 will be

one of the greatest vintages Beaujolais has ever known. The 2009

vintage in Beaujolais is showing signs of being a historic one that will
undoubtedly be celebrated by producers and wine lovers alike for years to
come.” -New York Times

The delicious reds and crisp Chardonnays featured here won First Prize at the prestigious
Concours des Grands Vins du Beaujolais. Monsieur Duboeuf selects these first prize-

winning cuvees especially for Sherry-Lehmann.
