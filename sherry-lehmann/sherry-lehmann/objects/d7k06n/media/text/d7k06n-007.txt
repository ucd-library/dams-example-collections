“Last year my good friend Michael Yurch of Sherry-
Lehmann visited the winery and once again persuaded
me to create a special bottling of my Hillside Cabernet
for him. The “Race Car” series has been a tradition since
2002 and this is the first red offering since 2003.
As a tribute to my former life as an Indy car driver,
| am proud to present him with this new 2006
Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, which | blended
especially for Sherry-Lehmann.” -Randy Lewis
