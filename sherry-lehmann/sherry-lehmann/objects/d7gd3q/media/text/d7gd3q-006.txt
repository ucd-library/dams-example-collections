have started to ship to New York. We have over 150 wines from California in our shop.

Whether it be a boat, a lawn, a terrace, or a

pleasant dining room - white wine is the drink of
the day during the Summer months. White wine
is tin.! At many Summer parties, it is dry white
wine that has replaced the gin and tonic, Scotch

‘on the rocks,’ and the highball .

Since Summer entertaining is leisurely and carefree,
white wine is the perfect answer. All you need is
a few bottles and a few glasses and you are ready.

Below we list outstanding, modestly priced examples
of superior white wines that will do their part toward
making warm weather living pleasurable and economical.
