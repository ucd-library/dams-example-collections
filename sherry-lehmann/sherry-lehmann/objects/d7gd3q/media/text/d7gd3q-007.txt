BORDEAUX REGIONALS

Discovered by Frank Schoonmaker

 

Several years ago, we visited Bordeaux with Frank Schoonmaker. We remember the care
with which he chose his regional wines that would bear his name. There was no attempt
at compromise. He tasted dozens of samples - and then finally made his selection which
would include Medoc, St. Emilion and Bordeaux Rouge among the reds - and a good, dry

 

Graves for his white. The wines listed below are from the same impeccable source, and
bear the FRANK SCHOONMAKER name on the label. They are certainly among the best
regionals we - or anyone else - have tasted. In light of the exalted prices that wines of
this caliber currently fetch, we proudly make this special offering. It is no ordinary event
to get a top-flight Medoc or St. Emilion at only $43.95 the case.

METHUSELAHS MAKE HISTORY
AT ROMANEE=-CONTI!

   

From 1760 - when the Prince de Conti was the
proprietor - until the present, the largest size
ever bottled at the renowned Domaine de la
Romanee -Conti was the 100-ounce Jeroboam
(the equivalent to four bottles).

HISTORY HAS NOW BEEN MADE!

The current prorietors -Lalou Bize Leroy and
Aubert de Villaine - have just bottled their
wines in the generous 202-ounce METHUSULAH
(the equivalent to eight bottles) - and the first
shipment arrived only a few weeks ago.

Wines of this caliber deserve such celebration,
This dramatic, incredibly large bottle enjoys
two important advantages - the sheer impres-
siveness of its size when served at an important
dinner; and the added longevity of the wine
due to the reduced ratio of air to liquid.

 

 

The impressive majesty of the
202-0z. Methusulah is apparent
when next to the 24-0z. bottle.
