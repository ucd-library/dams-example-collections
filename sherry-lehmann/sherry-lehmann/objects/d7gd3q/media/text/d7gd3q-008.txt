A True Vintage Port spends the first two years of its life in barrel - and is then put in bottle
Its maturation, as in the case of claret, takes place in the bottle, No wine in the world
captures the essence of the grape quite so perfectly as a fine Vintage Port. The House of
Sandeman is one of the great Port firms. Their Vintage Ports are true collectors items, and

are hard to come by, Fortunately, we are able to offer you examples from top-flight vintage
years - including the remarkable 1960s.
