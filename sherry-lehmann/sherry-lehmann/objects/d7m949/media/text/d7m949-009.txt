The effervescent, carefree joy of these French sparkling wines
will add their touch of delight to your more significant summer
entertaining occasions. EACH IS ON SALE-the French Cham-
pagnes represent the best of that remarkable area—and are
priced dramatically low in light of the high replacement costs
in the Champagne district today. The Haute-Savoie, Bordeaux
and Burgundy also contribute their best to add distinction to
your warm weather menus.

Bone-dry sparkling wine produced in Burgundy and fea-
tured at the excellent ‘Petite Ferme’ restaurant that has
become a gourmet gathering place in the Greenwich
Village area.

This utterly delicious, bone-dry sparkling wine from the
French Alps is served freely and enthusiastically at the
home of James Beard, America’s leading food authority.
Similar to, and quite indistinguishable from good French
Champagne, making a serious bid to being considered
the ‘best value’ available to lovers of good, dry Cham-
pagne. At this price, you can serve it without too much
economic concern, throughout the summer.

89 CAFE DE PARIS BLANC DE BLANCGS

BRUT (Bordeaux) 323. 24-2 ee 5.09 55.00
The most famed sparkling wine of France is produced
in the Champagne district but the price has now become
astronomic. The reputable firm of Cinzano-Dubonnet-
Cussnier (CDC) made an important decision. They se-
lected some of the best dry white wines of France and
brought out their virtues by using the slow Champagne
process in their limestone cellars in Bordeaux. The result
is CAFE DE PARIS-the fruity, truly dry, and utterly
delicious sparkling wine that may not achieve the ulti-
mate finesse of the best of the French Champagne, but
is wonderfully pleasing at any Champagne reception
where cost‘may possibly be a factor. You will be sur-
prised and delighted.

8 LAURENT PERRIER BRUT RESERVE..... 7.95 85.40
This glorious, dry, outstanding French Champagne will
not reach us until August but we feel we should tell you
about it now. Why? In an age when all famous French
Champagnes hover between $140.00 and $280.00 the
case, it is no ordinary event to be able to obtain one of
the best at $85.40 the case. We have put the first ship-
ment on sale—it will be available in limited quantities
sO we suggest you reserve your future needs now.

48 MERGIER EXGiRA DRY. 2 8.95 96.65
In blind tastings among French Champagnes, various
consumer tasting panels have proclaimed ‘Mercier’ as
best value within its class—a high honor indeed. World-
famous, truly excellent—dry, without being excessively
so—a Champagne of great distinction.

AMERICAN
CHAMPAGNES

With each passing year, the quality of the Champagne produced
within the borders of America moves upward in dramatic
fashion. Below, we offer New York State’s best value in ex-
cellence—and two prime examples of the heights that have
been achieved in northern California. You can now serve and
drink American Champagne proudly.

144 ANDRE MONGIER BRUT (N.Y.).......... 3.49 39.75
The American Champagnes produced in the Finger Lakes
district generally command about $5.00. We will match
this one, beautifully made and delightfully dry, with any
of them, and at only $3.49.

5 SONOMA VINEYARD BRUT............. 7.29 78.75

Schramsberg Crémant, a relatively sweet, fruity Cham-
pagne that is ideally suited to accompany desserts, and

Of late, we have been reading that experts consider
Cahors, the black wine from the high country, as the
best value of red wine in all of France. Certainly, Frank
Schoonmaker agrees when he states, “Slow maturing,
remarkably long-lived, firm, but not harsh, it has un-
mistakable distinction of its own...those interested in
wine and ‘discoveries’ will do well to seek it out.” It
sold for $3.75 only a while ago and we offer it to you
proudly at $1.99. This non-vintage is a blend of several
years—for those who want a more distinctive, longer-
lived version, we suggest the Cahors 1970 listed below.
