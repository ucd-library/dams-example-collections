BEAULIEU VINEYARD

Visiting Beaulieu Vineyard is not far removed from visiting a
great Chateau in Bordeaux. You will discover a beautiful turn-
of-the-century house, classic gardens, and great wines in the
cellar. The vineyard was established in 1900 by a Frenchman,
Georges de Latour, and here are red wines that are surely
worth laying down.

INGLENOOK VINEYARDS

Inglenook was founded in 1879 by a colorful Finnish seafarer,
Captain Niebaum. The family title subsequently passed on to
John Daniel. And then in 1964, this historic vineyard was
acquired by Heublein. The wines are excellent.

SOUVERAIN

Back in 1943, Lee Stewart, a wine lover, decided to enter the
wine business. He fell in love with an area, not far from St.
Helena, above the Silverado Trail. It started as a hobby, but
kept expanding. Only recently, Frank Schoonmaker became
associated with this beautiful vineyard dedicated to excellence.

LIVERMORE VALLEY

Because of its 30 mile width, Livermore looks rather like a
wild, rolling plain than valley country. Like Germany and
Bordeaux, the soil appears coarse and gravelly: These condi-
tions are peculiarly adapted to the cultivation of good white
wines.

WENTE BROS.

The Wente family came to this country from Germany during
the early ’80s, studied viniculture and started this remarkable
vineyard.

SANTA CLARA VALLEY

The better Santa Clara vineyards are located along the foothills
of the Santa Cruz Mountains which tower high above the
valley floor. Because of the need for further plantings, some
of the vignerons have extended their land holdings further to
the south.

ALMADEN VINEYARDS

Almaden was originally founded in 1852 by two Frenchmen
and has since been acquired by National Distillers. Here we
are dealing with the largest producer of varietals in California.

SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

This is the area, east of the Coastal Range, that produces quan-
tities of inexpensive, generic table wines. Many are undis-
tinguished, some represent good value for everyday drinking,
and some are eminently satisfying.

At Gallo, the largest vineyard in the United States, there is
much dedication to quality control with an emphasis on low
cost, so it can be enjoyed as an everyday wine.

NEW YORK STATE

Although the wine acreage in New York State is but a fraction
of the vineyard land in California, you will find here the same
sense of challenge and dedication to excellence.

BOORDY VINEYARD

While Editor of the Baltimore Sun, Philip Wagner, and his wife
Jocelyn, started a vineyard at their home property in Maryland,
experimenting with European wine grapes. They succeeded to
such an extent, that, in their quest for good vineyard land,
they established additional vineyards in upper New York State.
