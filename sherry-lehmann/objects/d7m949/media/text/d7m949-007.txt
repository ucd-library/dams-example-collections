RED BURGUNDY

Among recent vintages, ‘1970’ was the ‘star’ in Bordeaux; the
‘1969’ took the center of the stage in Burgundy—to be followed
by an even greater ‘star’ 1971, a year which some claim to
be the best vintage for red Burgundy since 1929.

It must be remembered that the great vineyards of the Céte
d’Or produce but a small fraction of the quantity yielded by
the chateaux in Bordeaux. This was particularly true of the
69s and ’71s, years that produced superb quality but pitiably
low quantity. The result was predictable. The prices for the
great names of Burgundy are now approaching the high levels
achieved by the famed vineyards of Bordeaux, and there is no
sign that they will come down in the immediate future.

We happily report that we bring you some of the great gems
of 1971 and 1969. Choose among them now—while a full selec-
tion is available—for surely most of them will be gone before
the end of the year and they are irreplaceable.

i971 RED BURGUNDIES

No. Bottle Case

AST. SPINOR NOIR: 5 eae ee ee 4.29 46.35
Don’t let the modest appellation which only indicates
the grape variety discourage you. In truth, we are deal-
ing with an excellent estate-bottling by Quillardet, pro-
duced skillfully on some of the better soil of the Céte
d’Or. If you are interested in what is in the bottle, and
not so much in what is on the label, here is a ‘best buy.’
Accidentally, the grower neglected to affix the vintage
label, but it is actually 1971.

itself-on the same exalted level as Musigny and Rich-
bourg. Estate-bottled, Pierre Gelin.

1969 VINTAGE

We know of no better way of testifying to the true excellence
of the 1969 red Burgundies than to simply quote Frank
Schoonmaker’s recently issued Vintage Report, “1969 is an
exceedingly great year in Burgundy, quite in the class with
fabulous 1961 ...deep-colored, rich, everything that fine Bur-
gundies should be...a few conceivably even 20/20, which is
as high as I can go.”’ We know of no more persuasive statement
to justify anticipating your future requirements than the ob-
jective evaluation by Mr. Schoonmaker—an opinion shared
unanimously by the Burgundy wine growers’ community.

252 PINOT NOIR DE MARSANNAY.......... 4.49 48.50
A ‘best buy.’ Estate-bottled by Guillemard on superior
Burgundian soil. Noble Pinot Noir flavor emerges.

Despite its small size, Vosne-Romanée is the most re-
markable and famed of the wine producing communes
of all France. Hard to come by, never inexpensive, worth
seeking out for its breed and elegance. Estate-bottled,
Mongeard-Mugneret.

315 NUITS ST. GEORGES, LES CORVEES....10.95 118.25
Rich, full, vigorous. Estate-bottled, Gilles.

338 CORTON RENARDES. . 2.5... 33h 11.95 136.25

apex of excellence during the 1969 vintage.

excellence.

passed by 1961.

355 NUITS ST. GEORGES, ARGILLIERES....12.50 135.00
Frank Schoonmaker is inclined to think this is the best

enthusiasm. Estate-bottled, H. Gilles.

212 VOSNE-ROMANEE, LA GRANDE RUE...19.95 215.45

OLDER
RED BURGUNDIES

Here are a few rare survivors of famed vintage years of pre-
vious decades. Because of their small size, Burgundy growers
cannot hold on to previous vintages in the same manner that
it can be achieved in the large estates of Bordeaux. As a con-
sequence, they are hard to come by and are much appreciated
by those wine aficionados who love fine old red Burgundy.
Here are a few remarkable examples that we are fortunate
enough to be able to offer you.

No. Bottle Case

325 CORTON MARECHAUDES 1962......... 7.95 85.85
Prince de Merode, the most important owner of Corton,
is particularly proud of his 1962 Marchaudes. Only a few
cases remain.

413 ROMANEE ST. VIVANT 1965............ 12.25 132.50
A blessed vineyard, next to Romanée-Conti, and now
produced by Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. Relatively
light, but the blessedness of the soil comes through with
distinction and clarity.

382 BEAUNE CHAMPINOTS 1961............ 17.95 193.85
Joseph Drouhin has been kind to our clientele and to us.
After continuous requests on our part for some of his
1961 reserves, which we have tasted, they finally con-
sented to send us a few cases. Here is red Burgundy at
its best.

907 CLOS DE VOUGEOT 1952............... 22.50 243.00
1952 was endowed in Burgundy with great longevity,

This wine is vigorous today. From the cellars of Paul
Bouchard.

948 CHAMBOLLE-MUSIGNY, CHARMES
LOS Fe th eee ee ye ee eae 34.50 372.60
The pride of the Hotel de la Poste cellars is this remark-
able 1934 which will impress you with its lively quality,
balance, and bouquet. A collector's item.

  

EAUX-DE-VIE

The beloved clear white brandies of France can bring a special
quality to climax the summer dinner party, particularly when
served icy cold. The very appearance of the frosted glass will
bring delight to the eyes of the beholder. The taste captures,
in flight, the fruit of the pear, cherry, plum and wild raspberry.
One bottle will go a long way—because 1 oz. in a frosty wine
glass will bring lingering pleasure as your guests joyously im-
bibe the bouquet.

Manguin produces pears on his island in the middle of

Another example of great Eaux-de-Vie discovered by
Jean Danflou. Made of wild raspberries gathered at high

CAREFREE WINES
FROM EVERYWHERE

WINE pre-dates recorded history and is grown almost every-
where. If you are looking for the great wines of the world you
will not find them below. However, you will find—in an age of
spiralling wine prices—several good, satisfying examples that
will not make too serious a dent in the family budget. Some of
these will represent previously untried journeys into wine
drinking—an Odyssey worth undertaking, particularly in the
summer when there is freedom and leisure to move into the
by-paths of the wine world. These wines are not endowed with
fame and recognition—but each will have its own personal
message.

1325 NORMANDY APPLE CIDER (France)..... 1.39 15.12

Baron de Rothschild was proud of the red wine he pro-
duced from the Cabernet Sauvignon grape in Bordeaux.
He sent vine cuttings to the Carmel wine growers at
Richon Le Zion. The happy result is this wine proving
that the noblest of the red wine grapes can produce a
wine of distinction in the relatively warmer climate of
Israel. Certainly, this is far and away the best red wine
we have ever tasted from this country.

867 CABERNET ISTRIA 1969 (Yugoslavia).... 2.59 27.97

duced here.
