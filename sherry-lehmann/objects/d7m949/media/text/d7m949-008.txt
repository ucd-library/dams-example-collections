WHITE BURGUNDY

In the winter, the rich red wines of Burgundy dominate; in
the summer and early Fall, the classic white Burgundies play
a more important role in menu planning. Below you will dis-
cover the best of the area—from the utterly pleasing low-cost
Chardonnay to the noblest of all Montrachets.

1973 VINTAGE

The yield was record-breaking. The result was that some wines
were too light and thin but others were glorious where they
did not overproduce. It forced us to taste the wines carefully
and choose discriminately so that only the best would reach
you—those with a full quota of body and fruit.

1972 VINTAGE

The whites from the Céte de Beaune fared well enjoying
sufficient acidity to keep’them fresh and alive for at least
another five years. In Chablis, however, one must be chosen
carefully since many are simply too astringent and tart.

1971 VINTAGE

We summarize Frank Schoonmaker’s vintage chart, “In Chablis,
a scant half-crop was produced at best-many wines destined
to rank among the best of their decade. As for the whites of
the Céte d'Or, they appear to be of wholly remarkable quality,
full-bodied, rather high in alcohol, yet well-balanced and
capable of improving if laid away... unlike any year we have
had since the 1961s.”

we only received a small fraction. So that a maximum

limiting our offer to bottles and not cases. Estate-bottled,
Comte de Vogiie.

1970 VINTAGE

The 1970 white Burgundies proved elegant, graceful, fruity, of
excellent balance with an observable tendency towards quick
development. They might be considered a happy synthesis of
66 and ’62—high praise by any standard!

This classic was estate-bottled by Bachelet-Ramonet. We
have put it up against Montrachets in blind tasting and
it obtained a higher score than half of the Montrachets
submitted. Would be good value at double the price.

RHONE VALLEY RED

These wines, among the best values in Europe, are produced
on both sides of the Rhone River starting below Lyon, and
proceeding 120 miles south as far as Avignon. In the opinion
of our most knowledgeable customers, the Cétes du Rhéne
Rouge, Vieille Ferme, which we offer, is possibly the best red
wine value in the United States. They also consider the Hermit-
age and Chateauneuf-du-Pape the equal of many Burgundies
that command much higher prices.

647, COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1972......... 2.29 25.95
Makes bid for being the best red wine value available
in U.S. CRAIG CLAIBORNE has extolled its virtues in
his newsletter and drinks it as his daily wine. We dined
with the grower recently and he advised us that the
superiority of his red wine is not only based on his
excellent vinification, but also because he uses a higher
ratio of the superior grape variety, Petit Syrah, compared
to the more common Grenache grape of the area. What-
ever the reason, in several decades of being wine mer-
chants, we have never had a red wine that captured the
imagination of those who want a good $2.29 bottle of
red wine more effectively than this one. Also available
in half bottles and magnums at $3.00 the case additional.
SPECIAL OFFER-—If you buy 5 cases fora single delivery,
the cost would be only $120.00, or an added savings of
$9.75.

at $3.00 the case additional.

it as “the manliest wine” he has ever drunk.

WHITE WINES FROM ALSACE

Gratifying indeed to the economy-minded wine lover, the ex-

cellent dry white wines of Alsace have not followed the upward

price graph of other areas of France. Buy them now while they
are still bargains—ideally suited for the beach house or hillside
retreat.
