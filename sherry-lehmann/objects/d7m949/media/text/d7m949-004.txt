RED BORDEAUX

1970 REGIONALS

We happily report, thanks to the record crop of the 1973 vintage,
that the price of Bordeaux regionals have moved downwards.
Only several months ago, it would have been impossible to
economically provide an authentic Bordeaux Rouge below $2.00.
We are not waiting for the more recent vintage to reach us
but reduce our prices below in anticipation of lower replace-
ment. Here, the best of the Bordeaux regionals are available—
all from specific vineyards—and all below $3.00 the bottle.

No. Bottle Case
713 BORDEAUX ROUGE, Chat. Marzarin .... 1.99 22.50

From one of the better chateaux of the Bordeaux area.
810 MEDOC, Chateau Franquette ............ 2.79 30.15

The Medoc includes the renowned towns of Margaux,
Pauillac, St. Estephe and St. Julien. It is from this su-
perior strip of land that this wine traces its origin.

670 ST. EMILION, Chateau Jacques Blanc..... 2.99 32.30
From a specific vineyard in St. Emilion. Round, soft—
ready now.

1971 VINTAGE

The great classified vineyards will not reach us until the Fall.
In the interval, we give you two superb examples that will per-
mit you to experience, in oustanding fashion, the excellence
of the 1971 vintage in Bordeaux, and offer the great Lafite
Rothschild for Fall delivery.

443. PAVES DES CHARTRONS .............. 3.54 38.25
Guy Schyler brings us this discovery, a happy blend of
the best wines of his unusual cellars. The name of the
wine reflects the fact that M. Schyler and his ancestors
have lived in the ‘Paves des Chartrons’ area since 1739.
Washington Irving was a frequent visitor to the Schyler
home. Montaigne, Montesquieu and Francois Mauriac
also maintained residences nearby. The excellence of the
wine reflects the nobility of the heritage.

448 CHATEAU LATOUR DE BY (Medoc)..... 3.99 43.10
Chateau-bottled from some of the best soil of the Medoc.
Big, fat, remarkable—long-lived.

A-1 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD

(Rautllachieise oe a - 295.00
In many instances, the 1971 vintage in Bordeaux has
shown greater depth, balance, intensity and longevity.
This is particularly true of Lafite Rothschild, with many
Bordeaux experts sharing this opinion. The 1970 sold for
$440 the case, and we would be the last to dispute its
magnificence and value. However, we are convinced,
that those who look ahead to future decades, would do
well to put away a case or two of the truly glorious Lafite
Rothschild 1971. With each passing year, the dividends
in drinking pleasure will increase. Delivery—Fall 1974.

1970 CHATEAU BOTTLED

We have all heard of the intrinsic greatness, warmth, depth
of flavor and longevity of the fabulous 1970 red Bordeaux—
undoubtedly the best vintage year in Bordeaux since the
legendary '45s and ’61s. Most have been spoken for because
of world-recognition of their excellence. The prices have
marched upwards from month to month but have stabilized
since the beginning of 1974 because of the strength of the
dollar in relation to the French franc. We do not know how
long this price plateau will last but we certainly think it
advisable to acquire these wines now while the selection is
complete and before scarcity force the prices upwards once
again.

We must remember that some of the First Growth ’61s are
now beyond $1,000 the case, and with the passage of time,
the same may ultimately be true of the First Growth 1970s. If
you think that you will want to drink these wines in the
future, now—not later is the time to obtain them.

CHATEAU LATOUR HAUT-VIGNOBLE.. 3.99 43.10
Not just an ordinary Medoc—but chateau-bottled at some
of the best soil of St. Estephe. Believe it or not, this wine
sells for a considerably higher price in Bordeaux on a
trade level today. Long-lived, will develop beautifully—
possibly the top value in top flight 1970 Claret available
in America today. We happily report that this wine is
also available in half-bottles and in magnums at $3.00 the
case additional.

We have watched the 1961 and 1959 Lafite climb beyond
$1,400 per case. Will this happen to the 1970s?
CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD

IN DOUBERSMAGNUME —-.-..-.......-.. 195.00 —

(equal to 4 regular bottles)
It was not Lafite Rothschild but Mouton Rothschild of
1929 (in the same size—the Double-Magnum) that recently
fetched about $9,000.00 a bottle at auction. However, the
vintage was 1929 and not 1970. Will the 1970, an equally
great year, and the vineyard is the great Lafite Roths-
child, fetch $9,000.00 the bottle in the year 1999? We do
not know. These giant Double-Magnums come from the
personal vineyard reserve of Baron Eli de Rothschild
and are true collector’s items. Not many are in existence.
It is the kind of wine that you can consider laying down
for your children and grandchildren who can drink it
joyously 25 years hence. Quantity limited.
