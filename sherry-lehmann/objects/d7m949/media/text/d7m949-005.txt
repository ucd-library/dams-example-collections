1967 CHATEAU BOTTLED

During a recent lunch with Alexis Lichine, he stated that the
best of red Bordeaux for current drinking is the 1967 vintage.
We are inclined to agree. The happy economic aspect is the
fact that they do not cost quite as much as the less-ready ’66s
and ’64s. You will find them exceptionally soft, fruity, and
utterly delicious for current drinking, and for the next 5 to 8

years.

233 CHATEAU MARQUIS DE TERME....... 6.99 75.50
Attention should be paid here! We are dealing with a
great growth of Margaux, classified in 1855. Fine texture,
very elegant, will live long—averages only 7,500 cases
a year. Worth much more.

purchase of three years ago brings dividends to the
consumer,

best single wine produced in the Medoe during 1967.

Frank Schoonmaker states this is the best of the ’67s.
A true long-lived glory.
1154) (CHAE AU: PEDURUGGs ons cc 39.50 426.60

In addition to intrinsic greatness, this is the scarcest of
the exalted wines of Bordeaux. Produces less than 20%
of a Lafite or a Mouton. Perhaps this accounts partially
for the high price.

1966 CHATEAU BOTTLED

A great, great claret year—a worthy successor to the classic
‘61s and an excellent precursor to the ‘70s. In the grand tra-
dition—beautifully balanced—long-lived. Rapidly disappearing
off the market.

CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD....... 34.95 377.45
The current wholesale Bordeaux price is 2,040 francs the
case. Translated into current dollars at 20.5¢ the franc,
this is $418.20. Since the 1961 Lafite is now well over
$1,000 the case, we strongly suspect this 1966 will reach
equally astronomical figures in about five years. Now
is the time to acquire it.
