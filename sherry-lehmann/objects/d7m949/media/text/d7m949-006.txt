Quick to mature, the excellent 1962 clarets are appreciated by
connoisseurs because they carry their full quota of complete-
ness to the wine-drinker who wants to enjoy a great wine
today, and not a decade hence. Few ’62s can be found in
Bordeaux because they have been spoken for by appreciative
wine-drinkers throughout the world.

CHATEAU BONNET 1972 22.50
From Entre-Deux-Mers and its lovely, rolling hills be-
tween the two rivers, Garonne and Dordogne. The quality
of these wines has improved dramatically in recent
years and they have moved from sweet to dry. Aston-
ishingly good value.
CHATEAU DOISY-DAENE 1970 32.30
A major portion of this Premier Cru Barsac vineyard is
devoted to the production of traditional sweet Sauternes.
Experimentally, and out of the same high heritage, they
have produced an intriguing dry Barsac that is worth
much more than the price you see here.
CHATEAU OLIVIER 1969 57.15
Famed example of excellent dry Graves.
CHATEAU BOUSGAUT 1970 6.69 72.25
Probably the driest white wine produced in the Graves
area. Similar to a white Burgundy in taste.
CHATEAU HAUT BRION BLANC 1970....16.95 183.05
The best dry white wine of Bordeaux and one of the great
white wines of the world. Less than 500 cases produced.
Very scarce. Acquiring any at all represents an
accomplishment.
CHATEAU D’YQUEM 1967 29.50 318.60
The greatest of the Sauternes produced during the great
1967 vintage. A sheer essence in the league with the
great Trockenbeerenauselse of Germany.

We had the 1959 at our last visit to Haut Brion. Provided
memorable wine tasting experience.

CHATEAU HAUT BRION 1918........... 95.00 998.00
This wine was born during a great year—a year that
marked the end of World War I and a year when the
sun, the rain and the climate were kind to the vignerons.
It was not only a memorable year but a long-lived one
for wine. This noble classic proves it when the cork
is drawn, and the richness and bouquet reward your
palate.

 

BEAUJOLAIS

Here are the most beloved red wines of France. Rich in fruit,
charm, and innocent attractiveness—wines that do not stress
intellectual qualities, but rather easy sensuality. In short, they
are not wines to be laid down for future drinking but to be
consumed joyously during the first few years of their life. All
of those listed below are from impeccable sources and among
them there is the Chateau de La Chaize—a vineyard that enjoys
the reputation of perhaps being the best single source of Beau-
jolais of the entire area.

1973 VINTAGE

The harvest was plentiful; the wines RUE, aya, = dehie
Brouilly, Chateau de La Chaize 1973, made history when it won
the Gold Medal both at the Macon Fair and at the Paris Expo-
sition. Never before, has the same wine won both Gold and
Silver Awards at both blind competitions in the same year. We
urge that you acquire this remarkable 1973 to add its delicious-
ness to your summer entertaining.

Chaize, is considered by
wine authorities as possibly
the best single example of
fruity, well balanced red
wine produced in the soil of
Beaujolais. As pointed out
above, it won Gold and Sil-
ver Awards at the Macon
and Paris Fairs. The Chateau
de La Chaize vineyard, in the
famed wine growing district
of Brouilly, has been maintained through successive genera-
tions for three centuries by the Marquis de Roussy de Sales
family. It will add distinction to your summer living, and the
price is astonishingly low in light of its eminence.

 

1972 VINTAGE

1972 is an interesting year in Beaujolais. Those produced on
the flatlands were too acid and lacked fruit. Those produced
on the better vineyards on the hillsides were more favored and
produced a beautiful balance of fruit and acidity. The wines
were particularly successful in the better areas such as Brouilly,
Fleurie, etc.

generic Beaujolais listed above.

A-3 BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES

(Chateau de la Chaize due September)... 2.99 32.30
This Beaujolais Villages represents the best value in
Superb Beaujolais we have ever offered. Why? Actually,
this wine is identical to the Brouilly of La Chaize listed
below, but French regulations permit the production of
only so many cases of Brouilly per acre or hectare. The
excess beyond the limit is not permitted to bear the name
Brouilly, but must be called Beaujolais Villages, even
though the wine is identical. This is exactly what hap-
pened in this instance, as testified to by the proprietor,
Marquis de Roussy. de Sales. If you forego the name, but
are willing to settle for the same wine in the bottle, we
suggest that you acquire this one and save $7.55 the case.

307, IMORGON: (Jean Bleton):.. =.=. 3.49 37.70
Morgon, among the most northernmost of the Beaujolais
vineyards, exhibits some of the characteristics of the
red Burgundies located even further north. Long-lived,
deep, excellent.

Sol BLEWURIE (A= Depardon) ===... 3.49 37.70
Fruit, balance, bouquet combine to give a light, delicious
Beaujolais.

265 BROUILLY, CHATEAU DE LA CHAIZE... 3.69 39.85
The Gold Award winning 1973 Chateau de La Chaize has
arrived and is described above. Remaining are only
about 200 cases of the truly excellent 1972 vintage, just
coming into its own. We have put it on sale at $39.85
so it can bring its distinctive pleasure to your summer
living.

267 MOULIN-A-VENT (Bourgeon)............ 4.49 48.50
The most exalted and expensive red wine produced in
Beaujolais. In some instances, it achieves the complexity
of the good red wines of the Céte d'Or. We have seen
Moulin-a-Vent listed in New York as high as $8.00 the
bottle—and none are better than this one.

1971 VINTAGE

Because of tannin and depth, this is the year that made Beau-
jolais taste like the wines of the Céte d’Or. Surprisingly long-
lived—the two listed below should continue to thrive for another
five years.

290 GHENAS 2 ee 3.99 43.10
Exceptionally favored Beaujolais area. Rich in fruit and
depth. Estate-bottled, Domaine Laneyrie.
