2005 WHITE BURGUNDY

“The 2005's will give pleasure to virtual-
ly all lovers of Chardonnay, and the
best of them have the stuffing and bal-
ance for at least mid-term aging and
perhaps more. Vintage 2005 will be an
easy vintage for the average customer
to buy.” -Stephen Tanzer

 

 

“Apt to be remembered for highly distinctive

and in the best instances profoundly deli-
cious Pinots...the 2008 red Burgundies
should on no account be overlooked,
provided one fancies their relatively
extreme style and chooses with care.”
