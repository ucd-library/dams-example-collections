1813. Today it is under the skillful guidance of Jean-Philippe Marchand.

Domaine Marquis
d’Angerville

The vineyards of this historic
| Domaine are among the finest in
| | | Burgundy. The grapes are hand-
picked and must pass a rigorous
selection process before vinification
and aging in oak casks. The results
are Pinot Noirs of extraordinary
balance and depth. The
Domaine’s 2007 Volnays are
restrained, elegant and complex
wines that are simply delightful.
