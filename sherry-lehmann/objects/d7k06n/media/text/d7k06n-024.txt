2006 RED BURGUNDY

“The Pinots also amazed me, with their
immediate charm, seduction and
balance. They are marked by ripe,
fresh, snappy fruit, more red fruits
than black, mellow structures and fine
balance. They are delicious now and
should be enjoyable over the short to
medium term.” -Bruce Sanderson,
