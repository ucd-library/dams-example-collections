Reserve Cognac & Armagnac
From Chateau Lafite-Rothschild

Michael Aaron tasted these extraordinary brandies after a gala dinner
at Chateau Lafite-Rothschild in 1984. He was so impressed with these
Reserves that he purchased

 
   
 

as much as Chateau Lafite-
Rothschild would let him have
in the mid 1980s. Now, after an

    
 

absence of almost 20 years, we

 
 

were able to convince Baron Eric

 
 

de Rothschild to send us a small

 
 

shipment once again from their

 
 

private stock. These very old

Cognacs and Armanacs come from
a careful selection done by the
Lafite tasting team decades ago!

 
 

They are extraordinary!

 
 

Each hand-blown bottle comes in
a wicker basket.
