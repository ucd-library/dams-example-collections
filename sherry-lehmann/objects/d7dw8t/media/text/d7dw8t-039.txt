AMARETTO DI SARONNO

THE ROMANTIC LIQUEUR OF ITALY

    
    

customary to send flowers and chocolates. The
sophisticated citizens of Italy send flowers and
Amaretto di Saronno.

Increasing, numbers of Americans are sending a greatly
appreciated gift, Amaretto di Saronno. When the
holiday dinner approaches its conclusion, often Amaretto
di Saronno, rather than Brandy or Port, becomes the
after dinner favorite of guests seeking refreshing alter-
natives. The bouquet and taste are of almonds, the chief
ingredient among many others, that made this liqueur so
popular.

Our advice—add Amaretto di Saronno to your
battery of after-dinner liqueurs and send it as a gift this
holiday season to introduce a fresh note.

This holiday season Amaretto di Saronno makes an
even more romantic gift since it is presented in a specially
designed box that plays an Italian love song the moment it
is opened! (3314)
