 

Bordeaux’s Historic ViNTAGES

tee aoe 7982 Vintage .+++++ +++

Since its infancy, 1982 has been the heralded vintage of the
century. It is considered by many wine critics to be in the same
class as the 1929, 1945, 1949, 1953 and 1961 vintages. Like
these other famous vintages, 1982 is becoming scarce. Our
advice: acquire these wine gems now while they still exist.

“Caught in the Shadow of the 1982 Bordeaux’’—that’s how The
Wine Advocate characterizes the excellent 1981 Bordeaux
vintage. It is a classic, long-lived, outstanding vintage. Although
these 1981 Bordeaux do not share the great drama and world
publicity of the historic 1982s, they admirably supplement
them. Perhaps one of the most appropriate ways to sum up this
vintage is noted in the new publication Medoce: “Today it [ 1981]
has almost come to full maturity and is the delight of connoisseurs,

even if it does not hit the headlines.”

“\.. Deep, dark ruby color, plenty of concentration,
blackcurrant flavors” observes Robert Parker. (545)

HAUT-BRION (Graves) 79.70 714.00
Plump, drinking beautifully now with good tannins for the
long haul. (834)

LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 89.97 1,079.40
Because of scarcity, Lafite 81 has become dramatically

Lehmann. (290)

Suppleness and velvet just emerging with a long life ahead.

PETRUS (Pomerol) 927.00 7,900.00

An extremely outstanding vintage for Petrus. (1017)

fe ee 1978 Wintage +--+.

A “miracle vintage” in Bordeaux. Great—in the classic tradition
of 1975, 1970 and 1961. Because these wines are scarce, the
replacement costs in Bordeaux have gone up over 65% during
the past few years. Our prices are based on our low early
acquisition costs.

depth achieved at this famed vineyard.

GRUAUD-LAROSE (Sr.-Julien) 36.979 443.40

’78 in a few years, but can be drunk now.” —The Wine
Spectator (427)

LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 197.00 2,340.00
The finesse of Lafite, combined with the remarkable power
of 1978, produces a dramatically rich wine experience. (209)

MOUTON ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 170.00 1,800.00

Obtaining Mouton 1978 is a rare wine treat.

that Taittinger’s expertise is
available on our native soil with
Domaine Carneros. Estab-

Taittinger’s beautiful Chateau

a knoll surrounded by its vine-

magnificent view of the rolling
hills of Carneros, San Pablo

The combination of climate,
California technology and Tait-

in a wine that has no modern
peers. Made from a blend of
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay—
grapes ideally suited to the cool
Carneros microclimate—Do-

great character. Delicate and lively, this handcrafted sparkler is of impeccable balance and

hateau Haut-Brion, the most illustrious

wine chateau to be known by name

and in 1855 it became the only non-Medoc red
Bordeaux to be awarded First Growth status.

The historic estate was acquired in 1935 by”

the American financier Clarence Dillon. Dillon
passed the estate on to his son, Douglas, and it
is currently managed by Douglas’ daughter and
son-in-law, the Duchesse and Duc de Mouchy.
The Dillon family has provided the means and

ognac lovers take note!

An increasing number of

our clientele — especially
those whose passion is for
Cognac in the poised, elegant,
and perfectly-balanced style —
are turning toa tiny family firm
called Delamain. And its no
small wonder! Delamain’s com-

careful grape selections have

one of the best sellers on the
premium end of the highly
knowledgeable British market.
Wise Americans are beginning
to follow suit.
“The firm only buys brandies at
least 15 years old from a few
growers, all in the Grande Cham-
pagne, keeping them for at least
another 10 years in one of the

houses. Delamain’s cognacs have
the intensity and elegance of some
fine clarets.”” comments Nicholas

After almost 30 years of aging
you will find Delamain Pale

CHATEAU LA MISSION-HAUT-BRION

In The Vine, Clive Coates writes: “La Mission is a
distinctive wine. It is totally different from its neighbour
Haut-Brion and it is the fullest and sturdiest of all the Graves
Crus Classes.” Of the white-wine vineyard, Laville-

Haut-Brion, he adds:

"\..a really top-quality white

Graves, a wine which, at its best, can be ranked with Le
Montrachet.”’
