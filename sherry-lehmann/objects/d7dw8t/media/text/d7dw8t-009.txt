From the beginning, 1989 has been heralded throughout
France as something of a miracle producing outstanding wines
in all regions. 1989 is, perhaps, the greatest white Burgundy
vintage of this decade. We quote The Wine Spectator: ''1989
impressed us at just about every level from simple Bourgogne blanc to
grandiose Corton-Charlemagne.””
