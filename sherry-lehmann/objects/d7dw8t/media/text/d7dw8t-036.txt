If Italy has a classic wine producing region long honored for its
tradition of quality, it is certainly Piedmont. Piedmont’s
standards of excellence do not stop at the pantheon of great
wines—Barolos and Barbarescos. Nor is regional style limited
to age worthy reds. Try a round, soft and ready Dolcetto with
roasted fowl or a sprightly Moscato d’ Asti with dessert—and
you'll see just how diverse and delicious this region can be.

Chianti is perhaps the first Italian wine an oenophile discovers.
The cheap, rustic, straw covered Chianti is, however, a thing of
a bygone era. Elegant Chianti Classico Riservas of today rank
amongst the wine prizes of the world. Magnificent
Brunellos are known as the wines of kings. Add to these a
bracing and delicious collection of fine white wine and Tuscany
becomes possibly the most exciting region of Italian wine
making today.
