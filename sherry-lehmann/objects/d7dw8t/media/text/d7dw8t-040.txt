“Me TORRES ye

A Remarkable Family of Spanish Wines
from a Remarkable Spanish Family

the ancient town of Villafranca del Penedes, some 35 kilometers

from Barcelona, since the 17th century. In the early 19th century,
Don Jaime Torres emigrated to the New World and made a fortune in oil
and shipping before returning to Spain and acquiring large vineyard
holdings in his native Penedes district. It was Don Jaime who began the
process of exporting his estate-bottled TORRES wines, first to nearby
Barcelona, and then to markets throughout Europe and America.

The Torres baton of leadership was passed on to Don Miguel Jr. earlier
this year upon the passing of the legendary Don Miguel Senior. Miguel Jr.
presides over the 1,000 acres of Torres’ prime vineyard soil in the
Penedes. Miguel Jr. has been the winemaker for many years as well.
Trained in both Spain and France, he has done significant research and
experimentation and combines the traditions of Spanish winemaking
with a mastery of the most modern techniques and philosophy. Marimar,
whose marketing concepts have spread the great word about Torres, is
responsible for Torres’ Wines North America.

The Torres dedication to quality and detail has won this historic family
praise throughout the world. ‘No producer has had as much impact on
Spanish winemaking as the Torres family” comments The New York
Times. If you’ve never experienced the excellence of this remarkable
family, here is an opportunity not to be ignored.

T he amazing Torres family has been making wine in the hills around

We quote Frank Prial from an article entitled ‘Bargains from
Spain,” which appeared in The New York Times Magazine: “It
would not be inaccurate to say that Spanish wines are one of the
best-kept secrets of the wine world. They range from simple,
uncomplicated table wines to sophisticated, subtle wines made for

connoisseurs.”

BRUT BLANC
DE BLANCS

An Ideal Sparkling Wine
for The Holidays

aul Cheneau was discovered in the

hills of Penedes, south of Barcelona

by Gerald Asher, Wine Editor of
Gourmet Magazine. Mr. Asher comments:
“Paul Cheneau Brut, like the very finest of French
Champagne remains in contact with the yeast for a
full 214 years. It is this yeast process that imparts
delicacy and fragrance, the gentle, long-lived
effervescence and silky balance.’

Paul Cheneau Brut has been one of our
most popular sparkling wines for over a
decade. Don’t let the low, low sale price of
$5.59 deceive you. This sparkling wine is
superb and not only ideally suited for large
receptions but also as a festive switch from the
popular “white wine” cocktail. Its taste is
“French” — but its price is “Bargain.” At
$5.59 how can you resist? (127)
