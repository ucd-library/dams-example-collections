aca ee IIEI Winlage - +++. 0.0..

Although sandwiched inbetween two historic Burgundy
vintages, the 1989 red Burgundies are worthy rivals to the
outstanding 1988s. The 1989s display round supple fruit
flavors, moderate tannins and should provide ample drinking
pleasure for many years to come. In The Vine, Clive Coates:
“The 1989s have a lot going for them. they have ripe, healthy,
sumptuous fruit in abundance, Acidities and tannins are at
acceptable but not dominate levels. The wines are supple and
charming. They will develop early.”

The Wine Spectator praises the 1988 red Burgundies as the best
of the decade! We quote The Wine Spectator: “Burgundy ends
the 1980s on a streak of good fortune. The 1988 red wines are out-
standing, close to ’85 in quality and perhaps even longer-lived . . .

“The wines have great depth and structure, with ripe, concentrated
black cherry and plum flavors and long, spicy finishes. Rich tannins
promise decades of development ahead.”
