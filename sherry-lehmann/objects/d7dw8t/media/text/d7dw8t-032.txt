Wine connoisseurs are aware that most of the great Chateaux of
Bordeaux blend various grape varieties such as Merlot and
Cabernet Franc with the Cabernet Sauvignon grape to create
many of the great classics of Bordeaux. Some of the best
vineyards of California make their wine by this same tradition.
Although these blends are predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon
and Merlot, rather than label them as a specific grape variety,
they have been given special names by their proprietors which
we refer to as “Classic Cuvees.” Listed below are the Classic
Cuvees of California that rank among the greatest red wines of
the world.
