THE

SINGLETON

A SINGLE MALT WHISKY
OF UNIQUE CHARACTER

he Singleton All Malt Whisky is of the highest pedigree. Born on the
banks of Scotland’s famed River Spey, Singleton is forged by the elements of
nature. Pure spring water, lightly peated malted barley and specially selec-
ted distillers’ yeasts all combine to give The Singleton its unique character.

The essence of The Singleton’s unique character is the water of Dorie’s Well. This
ancient Scottish spring is located on the Singleton estate at Auchroisk. From its
bed of granite, up through layers of fine sandstone, the well yields crystal clear
water of remarkable softness and purity. This is the life line of The Singleton All
Malt Whisky.

The Singleton is distilled in hand-beaten cooper stills and aged in oak casks for a
minimum of twelve years. Approximately two years before bottling, part of the
malt, known as "‘the heart,” is specially matured in oak sherry casks, imported
from Spain. This extra maturing process provides the key to The Singleton
character. It adds smoothness, enhances its rich, deep color and provides a
distinctive, nutty flavor.

The Singleton is enjoyed by connoisseurs throughout the world. Perhaps Mario
Pini, of London’s Selfridge Hotel, best sums up The Singleton’s unique character:
“Unlike some of the more traditional Malt Whiskies which necessitate an acquired taste
The Singleton is unusually smooth and easy to drink.” (2596)

the air. What is lost is known as “the angels’ share.” What remains slowly

acquires the oaken essence and amber color of mature Cognac. As a result,
there is a popular romantic belief that the angels consume more Cognac than all of
France.

The name “Hennessy” is synonymous with Great Cognac. Founded in 1765 by
Richard Hennessy, descendant of Irish Catholic immigrants and an officer in the
French army, Hennessy represents the largest firm in Cognac today. The distinctive
“Hennessy style’ owes much to its impressive stocks of 180,000 casks and to the
personal taste of the Fillioux family who have blended the Hennessy Cognaes for
over seven generations. Below are two of Hennessy’s great Cognacs left behind for
mortal enjoyment by “the angels.” Bottle (Cage

HENNESSY <¥V,s.0.P. 40.95 491.40

Produced exclusively from the two top-rated vineyard areas of Cognac—Grande and
Petite Champagne. Delicate, complex and smooth due to its long and careful aging
in old oak barrels. Here is a superb example of V.S.O.P. Cognac at its best. (2762)

HENNESSY X.O. HO205,.. ASSIA

A Cognac of great age, finesse and distinction. This superb blend was first made in
1870 by the great-grandfather of Maurice Fillioux, Hennessy’s present Maitre de
Chais and chief taster. From then until 1912, when it was first offered for sale to the
public, it was reserved for the private consumption of the Hennessy family and their
guests. (2764)

HENNESSY “PARADIS” 255.00 3,060.00

The oldest and rarest of all Hennessy’s Reserve Cognacs lie in a special cellar known
as ‘Le Chais du Fondateur.”’ The quality is so extraordinary that when you taste
Hennessy’s Paradis it will bring you close to Paradise—therefore, the name
“Paradis.” (2761)
