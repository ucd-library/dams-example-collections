“BOMBAY IS BEST” Say Gin Enthusiasts
The Original BOMBAY &

BOMBAY SAPPHIRE
GINS

hese superb English gins are representative of the great spirit of the British

Empire in its days of world glory. Bombay was the very heart of India in

the days of British rule, and the Bombay Sapphire was that subcontinent’s

most celebrated jewel—the epitome of the fabulous style, occasion and tradition
of that era.

The British have always been experts at making fine gin. Now, as in their
illustrious past, they insist that it be free of flaws—perfect for the gin drinks that
were so much in vogue at the height of the empire and are still appreciated by gin
connoisseurs the world over.

The original Bombay Gin is greatly esteemed and extremely popular. It is a
refreshing 80° proof gin, made from finely balanced mixture of eight exotic
botanicals. Bombay Sapphire, the ‘prestige cuvee” among fine gins, is 94° proof,
and ten natural botanical ingredients are used during the unhurried distillation:
grains of paradise, almonds, lemon peel, licorice, juniper berries, cubeb berries,
orris, coriander, angelica and cassia bar.

Both of these superb Bombay gins are presented in special packages for the
holidays. Whichever one you choose to grace your own household or give as a
gift will bring joy to those who appreciate the savor of fine gin.

THE CLASSIC CHAMPAGNES OF

The very name ‘Piper’ has become synonymous with Classic Champagne.
The fresh and elegant style of Piper has been pleasing champagne-lovers for over
200 years.
Perhaps this all got started when the founder of Piper-Heidsieck, Florens Louis,
visited Marie Antoinette at the Petit Trianon and persuaded her to switch to
Piper-Heidsieck Champagne. There she honored him for the excellence of his wines
and granted use of the royal fleurs-de-lys, making Piper-Heisdieck the only
Champagne house to receive such a privilege from the Court of France.
Piper-Heidsieck promises to be among the most festive of holiday Champagnes. Its
popularity and excellence is undisputed. Its quality will please the most “‘per-
snickety”’ of Champagne drinkers.

THE CAZES TRADITION

A MOST ENTERPRISING BORDEAUX FAMILY PRODUCES TWO OF PAUILLAC’S GRANDS CRUS CLASSES
SALE

 

Jean-Michel Cazes in front of Chateau Pichon-
Longueville-Baron.

hree generations of Cazes have made
an important contribution to the quality
and world acclaim that the wines of the
Medoc now enjoy. The family’s involvement with
wine began with Jean-Charles Cazes, a baker by
training who in the 1920s, beginning with meager
means, became a successful insurance agent and

 

famed wine-maker.
His son, Andre, now
76 years old, was
the mayor of Pauillac
for 40 years. He
expanded the family
insurance business
while running two
vineyards.

Jean-Michel
Cazes, Andre’s son
and the current dir-
ector of the Cazes
enterprises, is the
proud proprietor of Chateau Lynch-Bages and
director of Chateau Pichon-Longueville-Baron.
He acquired the habits of thorough dedication to
fine wine-making by following the philosophical
example of his grandfther, who had worked the
vines himself, getting up at five each morning to
feed the horses who pulled the vineyard machinery.
Jean-Charles Cazes’ expertise became legendary in
the region—in the 1940s and 1950s Lynch-Bages
won many blind tastings.

The nobility and elegance for which the wines of
Pauillac are acclaimed are beautifully evident in the
wines of Lynch-Bages and Pichon-Longueville-
Baron. Choose from among the selection of these
two outstanding vineyards.

She Great Borie Chateaux

Chateau Ducr uwBeaucatllou

We quote Robert Parker: ''The wine of Ducru-Beaucaillou is the essence of

 

n Bordeaux, family ties among the

notable chateaux are often

cherished links in the noble chain
of wine history: the Rothschild chateaux
that are gathered around the centerpieces
of Lafite and Mouton, the Cordier clan’s
brilliant collection that includes the grands
crus Gruaud-Larose and Talbot. Another
distinguished family grouping is that of
the domaines of Jean-Eugene Borie:
Ducru-Beaucaillou, Grand-Puy-
Lacoste, Haut-Batailley and Lalande-
Borie.

Ducru-Beaucaillou, the acclaimed St.-
Julien deuxieme grand cru classe, is certainly
head of the family, with Grand-Puy-
Lacoste, Haut-Batailley and Lalande-

Borie highly esteemed in their own ranks, —Jean-Eugene Borie in the
thanks to the care and perfectionism Vineyards of Ducru-Beaucaillou.

Monsieur Borie and his son Xavier bring

to every aspect of managing the vineyards and chateaux. Jean-Eugene Borie
inherited Ducru from his father and he is one of the Medoc’s few live-in
proprietors. Haut-Batailley has been in the family for over fifty years and its
quality has been steadily increasing. Grand-Puy-Lacoste and Lalande-
Borie are the most recently acquired jewels in the Borie crown.

Robert Parker writes of Jean-Eugene Borie: ‘His passion for his wine, his
obsessive commitment to quality, his numerous trips abroad as ambassador for

Bordeaux, and his remarkable modesty have made him one of his region’s most

respected wine personalities.”
