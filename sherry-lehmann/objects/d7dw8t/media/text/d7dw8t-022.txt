Two Elite Champagnes for Yuletide and New Year
BOLLINGER SPECIAL CUVEE BRUT

Comparative blind tastings place Bollinger
Special Cuvee Brut at the very apex among
non-vintage Champagnes. It is the proud
product of a small, quality-oriented firm that
has limited itself to a million bottles per year.
Most non-vintage Champagnes are aged one
year. At Bollinger, their standards are so

Only by imposing such restrictions can Bol- Champuy ae Ay Srance

Domaine Michel is tucked in the rolling
hills of west Dry Creek Valley, where the
variety of rich, fertile soil and solar exposures,
is well suited for the production of fine wines.
Originally settled as a land grant from the
King of Spain, the grounds were scattered
with grapevines, plums and walnuts. Owners
Jean-Jacques Michel and Ridge Bullock
brought together timeless traditions and
sophisticated technology to create California
wines of international quality and distinction.

The outstanding Cabernet Sauvignons and
Chardonnays produced at Domaine Michel
won immediate applause from our clientele
when we first introduced them over three
years ago. Wine critics have been quick to
rate them among the very best. If you have
not experienced the elegance of Domaine
Michel, here is an opportunity not to be
ignored!

DOMAINE MICHEL CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1987 [De 191.40
"The monumental 1987 Domaine Michel tastes much like a major California Cabemet
that’s normally priced way over $20 a bottle’ comments David Rosengarten (437)
DOMAINE MICHEL CHARDONNAY 1988 JOS 167.40
“Chardonnay grows better at the higher altitudes and copes well-with cool nights,” remarks
winemaker Fred Payne. This expansive 1988 is spicy, with hints of apple and
slightly more intense flavors than previous vintages. (760)

CHATEA

LAROSE-TRINTAUDON
1988 Vintage f=

A Girt On PH]
BORDEAUX |

e quote Robert Parker’s definitive

\ X / book Bordeaux: ‘'The style of wine

produced at Larose-Trintaudon has

proven to be an immensely popular one. Silky,

supple, blackcurrant flavors intermingled with

aromas of vanillin oakiness, medium body, and

light tannins are all telltale characteristics of the
wine of Larose-Trintaudon.”

CHATEAU LAROSE-TRINTAUDON—
the superb Bordeaux from Henri Forner’s
showplace vineyard in Saint-Laurent in the
Haut-Medoc—passes wine critics’ test with
honors. That is why we consider it—especially
when the vintage is as excellent as 1988—
among our favorite Bordeaux Best Buys.

Can you think of a better ‘every day’
Bordeaux than this? We can’t!

CORNEY & BARROW

LONDON’S FAMED WINE MERCHANT SENDS SHERRY-LEHMANN

BRUT DE PECHER

hile in France, Michael and

Christine Aaron were intro-
duced to the most wonderful tasting Brut
de Pecher at the restaurant Georges Blanc
in Vonnas when dining with Monsieur
Henri Gabet, the famed sparkling wine
producer of France. He brought a bottle
of Corney & Barrow Brut de Pecher
which immediately aroused their curi-
osity. There they were, in one of France’s
greatest three-star restaurants, sampling a
delicious cuvee blended especially for
Corney & Barrow —suppliers of wine
and spirits to Queen Elizabeth II, the
Queen Mother and the Prince of
Wales.

We are delighted that Corney & Barrow has been kind enough to share with Sherry-
Lehmann this special Brut de Pecher cuvee. You will be amazed by its semi-dry, delicate
balance and fragrant fresh peach flavors. Serve it icy cold by itself, or with orange juice to
create a refreshing variation of the Mimosa. When you sample this delicious sparkler you
will see why we were so excited. Corney & Barrow Brut de Pecher is one of the most
luscious peach sparklers we’ve ever tasted. (4026)

PAVILLON BLANC du
CHATEAU MARGAUX 1986

“... A Wine of Real Distinction . . .”” — David Peppercorn

ordeaux-lovers throughout
B the globe are well aware of the
extraordinary greatness and
rarity of the red wines produced at
Chateau Margaux. The proprietors,
Laura and Corinne Mentzel-
opoulos, are reknowned for their
care and dedication to excellence.
Corinne is now in charge of the day
to day operation of Chateau Margaux piping a dan a
and is considered to have inherited u
her father’s drive for perfection.
“Corinne was actually well suited
for the job. ‘She is a lot like her father,’ comments Emile Peynaud. ‘These are people
with great discipline and intelligence who work a lot. You know the saying, ‘like father
like son.’ Well, in this case, it’s ‘tel pere, telle fille’ (like father, like daughter).’””—The
Wine Spectator
But even more unique is a small quantity of superb dry white wine produced
at Chateau Margaux. David Peppercorn comments: “An excellent white wine,
Pavillon Blanc du Chateau Margaux, made only from Sauvignon grapes from a vineyard
in Soussans, is now a wine of real distinction. Its bouquet and breed are
remarkable. . .”’ (7155)
