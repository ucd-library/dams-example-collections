The much heralded 1988 red Bordeaux have just arrived. We
quote The Wine Spectator: As a stand-alone vintage, 1988
Bordeaux is first class, with a bevy of plush, elegant, richly flavored
wines at sound prices. 1988 boasts one of the greatest Bordeaux ever
produced...”

The 1988s below boast of generous fruit flavors and rich,
supple tannins. They are very stylistic and should provide
drinking pleasure for many years to come.
