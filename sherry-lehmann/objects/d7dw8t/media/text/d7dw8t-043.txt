est = KORBEL BRUT & NATURAL

 

O85 05%

orbel, a winery steeped in tradition, is a name instantly recognized. But few
K of us are aware that Korbel produced its first champagne in 1882 using the

classic Methode Champensoise. For over a century, the family firm of
Korbel Champagne has defined the elegant style of premium California
Champagne. In 1982 the Korbel family brought their Old Word skills to a new
country — that north of San Francisco. Here they found that the rich, sandy soil of
the Russian River Valley, combined with the early morning fog off the Pacific
Ocean and long days of Sonoma Country sunshine, resulted in a climate
perfect for producing some of the finest champagne grapes in the world.

Taking advantage of these favorable climatic condition, the Korbel family
pioneered the ‘California Style” of Champagne. Over the years, their crisp,
fruity style has become America’s most popular native champagne. Throughout
the years, the Korbel family of Champagnes has won top prizes in prestigious
wine competitions. Korbel is often the Champagne of choice for such official
celebrations as Presidential Inaugurations and Congressional swearing-in cere-
monies. Why not make Korbel a part of your celebrations this holiday season?

Recently, Robert Parker evaluated one of Oporto’s most
historic Port houses, Taylor-Fladgate. Mr. Parker
comments:
“Taylor is famous for producing the slowest developing
and most long-lived vintage ports. While those from most of
the other houses can be drunk with a great deal of pleasure
at the age of 10 or 15, most of Taylor’s Ports seem to require
a minimum of 15 or 20 years before their fragrant, nut-
scented, ripe fruit character and complexity emerge... .
“.... This is a great house that charges reasonable prices
for its recent vintages.”’
The House of Taylor has generously sent Sherry-Lehmann
some of their choicest nuggets. Choose among these
historic vintages.

The Ports listed below are not Vintage Ports, as they are
aged in wood, not bottles. However, the Tawny Port, the
20-Year Tawny and the 40-Year Tawny are endowed with
depth and complexity—characteristics normally associated
with Vintage Ports. These Ports are full, with a long,
lingering finish.

he history of Fonseca Guimaraens traces its origins
back to the early 19th century. Manuel Pedro FONSECA SIROCO WHITE PORT 13.50 162.00

Guimaraens represented the firm of Fonseca &
Monteiro, which conducted its trade in wine, foodstuffs,
olive oil and Port wines. The young Manuel Pedro took
over the company in 1822 by acquiring control of the
majority of the Fonseca holdings. Asa condition of the sale,
the departing Fonseca stipulated that his name be retained,
not only as a brand name, but also as a family name for
whoever should own the business—hence Fonseca
Guimaraens. Today the name is often shortened to
“Fonseca.”

Manuel Pedro Guimaraens was a man of diverse ac-
complishments. Known for his lavish entertaining in
London, he was also devoted to politics and liberal activism
and he became one of the founding members of the Royal
Botanical Society. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of his
Port business led Fonseca to become the second largest
exporter of Port wines by 1840.

The tradition continues. Consistency of style has remained
a fundamental principle of the Fonseca philosophy. Hugh
Johnson, in his Modern Encyclopedia of Wine, observes:
“Fonseca is regularly one of the finest and richest vintage Ports
and their Bin 27 (is) an admirable youngish tawny.”

Choose among the Fonseca Ports listed. Each will add its
own distinction and charm to holiday festivities.

 

White Port is a relatively recent phenomenon. Produced
from white grapes only; it is crisp, round, velvety—with a
refreshingly acidic balance. Served well chilled or on the
rocks with a twist, it makes a festive holiday aperitif. (1616)

FONSECA BIN NO. 27 13.95 167.40
Similar to a late-bottled vintage Port, Bin No. 27 exhibits
the characteristics of a true vintage Port. Rich, full-bodied,
with luscious blackcurrant and cherry undertones. (1614)

FONSECA SPECIAL RESERVE TAWNY PORTS
Historically, tawny Port is the youngest of red Ports. As
they age, they develope elegant, ripe, fruit, crisp acidities
and warm nutty overtones.
