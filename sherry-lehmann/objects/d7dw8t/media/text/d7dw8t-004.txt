then re-evaluates his selections with the Sherry-
Lehmann tasting panel. The results are the very best wines
that M. Duboeuf has to offer. These are the wines listed in
this catalogue. This year’s 1990 Beaujolais and Maconnais
wines have all won first prize at the annual Villefranche
and Macon wine fairs. Each bottle is beautifully adorned
with the ‘FLOWER LABEL,” expressing the fact that
Georges Duboeuf has chosen his best wines for our
prestigious First Prize bottling.

In The Wine Advocate Robert Parker comments on
Georges Duboeuf: 'Beaujolais’ most famous wine producer,
and perhaps its finest, is Georges Duboeuf, . . . because of his fair
prices, consistently high quality, and total commitment to
authentic wines of each appellation, Duboeuf has almost single-
handedly made the civilized world aware of the glorious,
hedonistic, yet simple pleasure of a bottle of Beaujolais.”

We quote Mr. Beaujolais, Georges Duboeuf, on his
1990 vintage: "I love this type of vintage where there is a large
range of quality, where the grower’s paid special attention to their
fine technique and know-how. It is a priviledge to send to
Sherry-Lehmann my Flower Label Beaujolais which I
know to be the best of the vintage.”

Dear Michael

Good wine has only one master and 1991 is the year Mother
Nature kissed Beaujolais.

During this past year, we have seen all the whims of the weather.
At the end of April, we had severe frosts. In May and June,
localized hailstorms pervailed and totally destroyed the vineyards
that they hit. Then mainly in July and August, we were blessed
with wonderful sunshine and beat, sometimes almost too intense.
August was the hottest month we have known for many years
bringing a heatwave that lasted several weeks.

The vines were subjected to all the extremes that Nature can
inflict. The vineyards were put through the harshest tests of the
severe assaults of the weather. The results are now coming in
—an average crop in quantity, but of very good quality, one
of the most glorious years!

I should add, purely by intuition and perhaps prematurely, but
with conviction, that Beaujolais will be the most favored
wine region in France.

It is with great pride that I send Sherry-Lehmann my Specially
Selected Flower Label Beaujolais Nouveau 1991 from
my best barrels. It flourishes with good character, excellent fruit
and rich flavours of ripe berries such as strawberry and cherry.

With all my warm wishes,

ee

Georges Duboeuf

From the very beginning, the Jordan style redefined

8 September 1987

This morning I took the 6:30 flight from Lyon to Bordeaux,
arriving at 7:30 A.M. By 8:45, thanks to the expert driving of my
host, Max Cointreau, I found myself here at his fabulous
Distillery Domaine Frapin, in the privileged Grande
Champagne District in the very heart of Cognac, breakfasting on
the best coffee and croissants I have ever tasted.

FRAPIN

For over 500 years the Frapin family has been growing vines,
and they are now the proud proprietors of the largest vineyard on
one plot of land in all of Grande Champagne Cognac.
Genevieve Cointreau, the 21st generation of the Frapin family on
this land and now President of Domaine Frapin, married Max
Cointreau former President of the famed Cointreau liqueur firm.

Because all Frapin Grande Champagne Cognac comes from a
single vineyard. Frapin is one of only a few firms entitled to
print the word—Domaine—on their Cognac label.

After a marvelous lunch at the nearby Moulin de Cierzac I
experienced the joy of tasting the Domaine Frapin Cognac. This
particular Cognac has been aged for a number of decades and
includes some of Frapin’s best stocks of Antique Cognacs all
from a single, exquisitely situated vineyard. The result is
simply quite extraordinary. First, there is a highly developed nose
and then comes the perception of a unique bouquet, distinct and
elegant. Finally, the taste. Ah, the taste! An amazing combination
of richness, mellowness and roundness, and yet a hint of
silkiness. And what a beautiful colour. A true gem.

For the first time, the rare Domaine Frapin Cognac is
available in America, at Sherry-Lehmann. I urge you to acquire
and enjoy this superb Vieille Grande Fine Champagne
Cognac which has just reached our shores.
