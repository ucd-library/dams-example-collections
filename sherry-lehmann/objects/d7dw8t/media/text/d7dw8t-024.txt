A Bounty of Country WiNEs

seeee French County Wines +++:

Leisurely stopping along the road in numerous picturesque,
quaint villages of the French countryside, visiting local cafes
and bistros is a romantic way to experience France. What
makes visits like this even more memorable is savoring the local
wines served at these establishments. Often produced in small
quantities, these wines sometimes never get further than the
area in which they are made. Nonetheless, these regional wines
traditionally represent some of France’s most intriguing wines
— and some of France’s best wine buys.

Many of our wiser clientele have long been aware of the treasure
trove of wine excellence from the vineyards of Alsace. We
quote from an editorial in Time Magazine: ‘Critic Robert M.
Parker Jr. calls Alsace ‘the world’s most underrated white-wine
region,’ and to most Americans it is unknown territory. . . Unlike
the sweetish Rhines and Moselles of neighboring Germany, Alsace’s
crisp Pinot Blancs, spicy Gewurztraminers and luscious
Rieslings are flowery in bouquet but normally bone-dry in
taste, in short, ideal companions to . . . shellfish, grilled chicken and
pasta salad. (Gewurztraminer has a peculiar affinity for Chinese and
Indian dishes.)””
