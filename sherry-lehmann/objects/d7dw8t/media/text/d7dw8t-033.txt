The Wine Advocate, Robert Parker
ERNEST ANDJULIO GALLO 1978 CABERNET SAUVIGNON- PRIVATE RESERVE SONOMA

Only 1,000 cases of this Sonoma Cabernet Sauvignon have been produced. It
should not be confused with the 1978 Gallo Cabernet Sauvignon released several
years ago. This Private Reserve bottling has been aged 12 years by Gallo prior
to release. The wine is excellent, close to outstanding in quality. Dark
ruby/garnet, with a rich, cedary, cassis, and spicy bouquet, full-bodied, rich,
intense, well-balanced, and complex, as well as long, this is a top-flight Cabernet
that should continue to drink well for at least another 5-8 years. Gallo has nearly
2,000 acres of vines in Sonoma, so I hope this is the first of many Private
Reserves to be released. (20.00) Rated 89

 

 

For the past decade, Ernest and Julio Gallo have been eager to alter
their image as jug wine giants and enter the super premium segment of
the international wine market.

Last year Michael Aaron visited the Gallos where he had the opportunity of
tasting their extraordinary Cabernet Sauvignon Private Reserve 1978. ‘I was
amazed. Its deep ruby color is only an introduction to its beautifully balanced bouquet
and subtle Cabernet flavor. It could very well be the best Cabernet Sauvignon from the
1978 vintage produced in California” reports Mr. Aaron.

Mr. Gallo was so pleased with Mr. Aaron’s praise that he has been kind
enough to send to Sherry-Lehmann 100 cases from the total production of 1000
cases. 200 cases have been reserved for the Gallo’s personal use in their home.

Thank you Ernest and Julio Gallo for sharing your treasure with the
clientele of Sherry-Lehmann.

When you sample Gallo Cabernet Sauvignon Private Reserve 1978, you will
see that it’s time for a change to Gallo. (777)

 

Michael Aaron thanking Emest Gallo for permitting
Sherry-Lehmann to acquire a limited allotment of their
tare and spectacular Private Reserve Cabernet
Sauvignon 1978.

t’s not easy to find a seven-year old American

Cabernet Sauvignon. Because Ernest and
Julio Gallo believe a fine wine should be allowed
to mature before it’s released, we are proud to
offer their 1984 Cabernet Sauvignon. Made from
100% Northern Sonoma Cabernet grapes, aged
in European Oak and then carefully cellared—it
is now ready to be enjoyed this holiday season
and for years to come. It’s time for a change to

Gallo. ( (940)
