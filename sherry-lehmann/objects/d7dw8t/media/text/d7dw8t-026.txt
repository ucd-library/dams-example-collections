aster Elchies, the ancient Macallan manor-house on the banks of the river
3 Spey, has been the site of great whisky-making for centuries. The Macallan

distillery was accorded formal license in 1824. When Master Blender
Roderick Kemp procured the distillery in 1890, he had one clear purpose: to create a
single malt Scotch of uncompromising quality. Frequently visited by travelling
herdsmen, the Macallan reputation of superb quality quickly spread. Today the
outstanding single Malts from Macallan are acknowledged to be among the very
greatest of Scotland.

A Champagne of Symphonic Harmony

by many Champagne-lovers as the equal of esteemed vintage
champagnes and “‘tete de cuvees.’’ Krug Grande Cuvee is a
remarkable blend of 40 to 50 wines representing three grape varieties
from 6-10 vintages—all expertly assembled by Henri and Remi Krug to
achieve a magnificently harmonious Champagne. The cuvees that
represent the best complementary qualities are chosen—to bring
elegance, structure and fine flavor to the final blend—as strings,
woodwinds and brass combine to make the most exquisite of symphonies.
Perhaps this is why Krug Grande Cuvee is served so often at the Club
des Cents, the leading gastronomic club of Paris. And perhaps it is why
Krug was the Champagne served at the private wedding breakfasts at
Buckingham Palace immediately following the two most recent royal
weddings. This Christmas why not make Krug Grande Cuvee your

number one Champagne. (16)

“Sauvion is to the Muscadet region of the vast Loire River basin
what Georges Duboeuf is to Beaujolais—the area’s most successful,
and frequently its best producer and bottler of top quality Muscadet.”
—The Wine Advocate, Robert Parker.

Many of the wines we list below are from the much heralded
firm of Sauvion et Fils, headed by Jean Sauvion, affection-
ately known as the ‘Wine Wizard of the Loire,” as well as a
few other producers of high caliber.

“CLER’ BLANC, Sauvion 4.89 98.50

Featured in Barbara Ensrud’s Wine Buy of the Week.
Ms. Ensrud comments: “This crisp, sprightly white is a
crowd-pleaser . . . Created by Jean Sauvion, one of the
leading Muscadet producers, Cler’ Blanc is nonvintage but so
fresh you know it is young. It’s dry but very fruity, quite light,
with a slight tingle on the palate. Sauvion manages to capture
this clean, lilting freshness year after year—I guess that’s why
he’s known as ‘the wine wizard of the Loire.’” (484)
