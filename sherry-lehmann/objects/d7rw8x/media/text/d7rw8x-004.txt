BEAUJOLAIS

Here are the most beloved red wines of France. Rich in fruit,
charm, and innocent attractiveness—wines that do not stress
intellectual qualities, but rather easy sensuality. In short, they
are not wines to be laid down for future drinking but to be
consumed joyously during the first few years of their life. All
of those listed below are from impeccable sources and among
them there is the Chateau de La Chaize—a vineyard that enjoys
the reputation of perhaps being the best single source of Beau-
jolais of the entire area.

1973 VINTAGE

After the 1973 crop was gathered, there was joy in Beaujolais.
The harvest was plentiful; the wines fruity, typical. This kind
of wine is bottled immediately after November 15th, or less
than 2 months after the harvest. Ours will be put on a fast
boat from Le Havre and will be available for delivery during
the first week of December.

BEAUJOLAIS ST. ANDRE ............... 3.79 40.93
The best Beaujolais nouveau produced since 1970. Avail-
able for delivery during early December.

1972 VINTAGE

The 1971 vintage in Beaujolais was atypical—it was rich in
tannin and concentration of flavor, developing longevity and
depth but with less obvious fruit. 1972 reverts back to what
Beaujolais is all about—this means a simple wine, very light,
fruity and designed for drinking over a short period of time,
not for laying down. The best of the 1972s have reached us and
they are here for immediate enjoyment or as a joyous wine to
send to a friend for Christmas.

1073 BROUILLY—CHATEAU DE LA CHAIZE-—

IN 18 OZ. PICHETS 2.69 29.05
What is a pichet? It is a handsome 18 oz. bottle that rep-
resents a useful midpoint size between the usually insuf-
ficient 12 oz. half-bottle and the standard 24 oz. full
bottle. When it is ‘dinner for two,’ you can feel generous
about your wine drinking and yet avoid the possible
waste of a full bottle. As for the wine, it is probably the
best example of Grand Cru Beaujolais that is being
shipped to the United States. Try a case—you won't re-
gret it—or send it as a gift.

BEAUJOLAIS (J. Cimetiere) .............
Vigorous, rich in fruit, excellent.
BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES (Bourrat) 2.99 32.30
From one of the 25 outstanding villages of Beaujolais.
With more depth, alcohol and flavor than the more
generic Beaujolais listed above.
MORGON (Jean Bleton) 3.49 37.70
Morgon, among the most northernmost of the Beaujolais
vineyards, exhibits some of the characteristics of the
red Burgundies located even further north. Long-lived,
deep, excellent.
FLEURIE (A. Depardon) ................ 3.79 40.95
Fruit, balance, bouquet combine to give a light, delicious
Beaujolais.

265 LA CHAIZE.. 3.89 43.50
This Brouilly 1972, estate-
bottled at Chateau de La
Chaize is considered by the
wine authorities of France
as possibly the best single
example of fruity, well bal-
anced red wine produced in
the soil of Beaujolais. It has
consistently been the best
selling red wine in our his-
tory—everyone loves it and
comes back for more. The
Chateau de La Chaize vine-
yard, in the famed wine growing district of Brouilly, has
been maintained from father to son for three centuries
by the Marquis de Roussy de Sales family. Also available
in half bottles, magnums, jeraboams—and the beloved
18 oz. pichets which are described above.

MOULIN-A-VENT (Bourgeon) 4.49 48.50
The most exalted and expensive red wine produced in
Beaujolais. In some instances, it achieves the complexity
of the good red wines of the Céte d'Or. We have seen
Moulin-a-Vent listed in New York as high as $8.00 the
bottle—and none are better than this one.

379 BROUILLY, CHATEAU DE LA CHAIZE... 3.89 43.50
Marquis de Roussy de Sales, the proprietor of this out-
standing Brouilly vineyard, is of the opinion that, like
his 1934 and 1945, his 1971 will remain vigorous, beauti-
ful and remarkable for at least another decade. However,
with the passage of time, the character will change—and
those who prefer their Beaujolais young and fresh should
drink it now joyously.

sibly, this is the best selling single Beaujolais in the
United States.
