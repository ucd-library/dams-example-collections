1966 CHATEAU BOTTLED

A great, great claret year—a worthy successor to the classic
’61s—and an excellent precursor to the ’70s. In the grand tradi-
tion—beautifully balanced—long-lived. Rapidly disappearing off

the market.

Worth pausing here. Note low price for one of the best
examples of chateau-bottled St. Emilion available—and
it is 1966!

CHATEAU FOURCAS-HOSTEN ......... 5.99 64.70
Important Médoc vineyard recently acquired by a group
of Americans, including our good friend, Frederick
Palmer, a director of the Chemical Bank. Excellent bal-
ance, much finesse and flavor.

CHATEAU MARQUIS DE TERME ....... 6.99 75.50
Comparatively, even if this Grand Cru Margaux vineyard
sold for $10.00 a bottle, it would represent good value
in today’s world market. At $75.50 the case, it can be
considered an unequaled opportunity. Irreplaceable.
GHATEAUW -PAWIES 92... 5tc tse: 9.95 107.45
Grand Cru St. Emilion. Just returned from a visit to the
vineyard—impressed by their excellence and dedication.

CHATEAU MOUTON BARON PHILIPPE.. 9.95 107.45
Adjacent to Mouton Rothschild there exits another
Grand Cru vineyard called ‘Mouton Baron Philippe.’ It
shares the same proprietor, Baron Philippe de Rothschild.
However, the more famed of the baron’s two vineyards
commands five times the price. This wine provides an
opportunity to participate in outstanding excellence
without paying astronomic cost.

flected in the balanced excellence of the wine.

praise from the Wine Writers Circle. Excellent.

Great distinction, power and finesse. The ideal wine for
laying down.

Lafite, Latour, Margaux and Haut Brion.

CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD ....... 49.50 534.60
From what is possibly the greatest red wine vineyard in
the world. Will probably be over $1,000 the case before
this decade ends.

179 CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC ............ 34.50 372.60
