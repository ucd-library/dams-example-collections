RHINES AND MOSELLES

The better Rhines and Moselles often reach superb heights—
particularly during the 1971 vintage, the best since 1953—and
are certainly among the best white wines produced anywhere
on the globe. Despite the upwards reevaluation of the German
mark and the devaluation of the dollar, we are happy to report
that you can drink superb estate-bottled examples at liveable
prices. For best values for present drinking we particularly
commend the 1970 Rhines and Moselles that are offered here
below $40 the case—you will not regret their acquisition.
