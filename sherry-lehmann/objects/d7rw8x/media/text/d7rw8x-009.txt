 

SPAIN

There is more vineyard land in Spain than in any other country
in the world—less than 3% is Sherry. The best table wines are
from Rioja and some good ones are produced in Valdepenas.
Look for the old vintage wines of Rioja which are among the
best values in outstanding red wine extant today. For those
who want good everyday red table wine of quality, don’t over-
look either the Banda Azul or the Cune Clarete—both are
excellent.

AUSTRALIA

AUSTRALIA is vast, blessed by nature—enjoying many vine-
yard microclimates, some duplicating the conditions of Bor-
deaux, northern California or Burgundy. The versatility of
Australian soil has made it possible to produce a Cabernet
Sauvignon as in Bordeaux; a Riesling as on the Rhine; and a
Grenache Rosé as in the Rhéne. The quality of the wines that
we have received from THOMAS HARDY has astonished us—
and will delight you, not only because of intrinsic merit, but
also because you will now be able to obtain superior wines at
well below $3.00 the bottle.

Thomas Hardy was a farmer from Devon who started his vini-
cultural endeavors in Australia during the 1850s. Dedication to
the grape and vineyard acquisitions continued through five
Hardy generations. Today, Thomas Hardy is Chairman, having
served for three years as President of the Wine Makers Asso-
ciation of South Australia. His sons, Robert and David, have
degrees in oenology, have spent years in the vineyards of
Europe, and David has studied viniculture at the University of
California. The results of this family continuity, love of their
wine-making art and professional knowledge become apparent
when the wines are tasted. Informed wine friends tell us that
perhaps the best wines of Australia come from the cellars of
THOMAS HARDY & SONS.

RED WINES

No. Bottle Case

595 ST. THOMAS BURGUNDY 1970 ......... 2.49 26.90
Produced entirely from the Hermitage grape (the same
as Syrah, the best grape of the Rhone Valley) in the
Tintara vineyard at McLaren Vale, South Australia. Full-
bodied, smooth—less tannin than the claret.

593. NOTTAGE HILL CLARET 1970 .......... 2.49 26.90
Named for Thomas Nottage, the nephew of the original
founder. The vineyard is on the side of his original 19th
Century home. Soft, balanced—in the style of a good

Medoc.
WHITE WINES
Biz MOANA WHITE BURGUNDY 1971 ...... 2.49 26.90

Medium to full-bodied; yet delicate—fresh bouquet.
Rather like a Pouilly-Fuisse.

535 JOHANNISBERG RIESLING 1971 ........ 2.49 26.90
Made from the Riesling grape of the Rhine. Grown in
the Hunter River Valley at a high altitude, enjoying a
cooler summer. This means the grapes ripen with less
sugar, higher acidity, thus imparting briskness, freshness
and delicacy.

VIN ROSES

517 GRENAGHE- ROSE 1969 -<.:.......:..<.. 2.49 26.90
Grenache is the classic grape for making Vin Rosé. It is
used in Tavel, Provence, northern California—and reaches
excellence in Australia. Dry.
