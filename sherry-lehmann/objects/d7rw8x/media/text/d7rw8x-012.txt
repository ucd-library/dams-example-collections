NAPA VALLEY (contd)

BEAULIEU VINEYARD

Visiting Beaulieu Vineyard is not far removed from visiting a
great Chateau in Bordeaux. You will discover a beautiful turn-
of-the-century house, classic gardens, and great wines in the
cellar. The vineyard was established in 1900 by a Frenchman,
Georges de Latour, and here are red wines that are surely worth
laying down.

HEITZ WINE CELLARS

Joe Heitz is to California what the Domaine de la Romanée-
Conti is to Burgundy—small, dedicated to the making of great
wine, expensive, but worth the cost. Joe Heitz graduated in
oenology from the University of California—and he and his
wife, Alice, have been working day and night for a decade to
make what they hope to be the best wines of their state. The
Heitz wines are rationed in California—a pitiable small quantity
reaches New York—and we offer them below, while our inven-
tory remains to those who want to experience the heights that
can be achieved in California.

CHAPPELLET

Donn Chappellet abandoned his commercial empire in San
Francisco—moved his family to a hundred acre vineyard 1,500
feet up in Pritchard Hill above the Napa Valley. This move on
his part was dramatic enough to win him a 2/3 page write-up
in the New York Times. The wines reflect his dedication—they
are expensive—but will intrigue those who want to know the
kind of excellence that can be achieved in America.

SOUVERAIN

Back in 1943, Lee Stewart, a wine lover, decided to enter the
wine business. He fell in love with an area, not far from St.
Helena, above the Silverado Trail. It started as a hobby, but
kept expanding. Only recently, Frank Schoonmaker became
associated with this beautiful vineyard dedicated to excellence.

FREEMARK ABBEY

Freemark Abbey was originaly built in 1895, and recently re-
stored by seven vineyard owners dedicated to making the best
wine in California. It proved itself at a tasting we recently
attended where their Pinot Chardonnay, against a field of 28
competitors, including great wines of France, achieved the
highest point score, or best of the lot.

LIVERMORE VALLEY

Because of its 30 mile width, Livermore looks rather like a wild,
rolling plain than valley country. Like Germany and Bordeaux,
the soil appears coarse and gravelly. These conditions are pe-
culiarly adapted to the cultivation of good white wines.

WENTE BROS.

The Wente family came of this country from Germany during
the early '80s, studied viniculture and started this remarkable
vineyard. It is their Pinot Chardonnay that won the enthusi-
astic endorsement of inspectors from Guide Michelin, who com-
pared it to the best Meursaults.
