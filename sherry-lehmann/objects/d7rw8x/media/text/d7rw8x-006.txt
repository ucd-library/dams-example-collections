JOURNAL reports in its
April issue, ““We found a
red wine that is honest
and dry and clean to the
palate. It is a 1971 from
the Rhéne Valley, bottled
at the vineyard called La
Vielle Ferme—it is excel-
lent and the equal, we
feel, of the much better
known and neighboring Chateauneuf-du-Pape, which it
resembles. We predict that if the wine is properly stored,
it will have softer qualities within a year or two. Also
available in magnums at $5.16 each, $28.95 case of 6. Also
available in half-bottles at $1.29 each, $28.95 case of 24.
Incidently, for those who would want further informa-
tion about subscribing to the ‘Craig Claiborne Journal,’
it is suggested that you write Craig Claiborne, P.O. Box
EEAA, Easthampton, N.Y. 11937.

CROZES HERMITAGES 1969 ............ 3.99 43.10
From the vineyards surrounding Hermitage overlooking
the Rhéne River. Similar in characteristics to Hermitage
itself, but with a little less depth, maturing more quickly
—however, it is considerably less expensive. Estate-
bottled, Fayolle.

GORNAS W969) 2. one ee ee 3.99 43.10
Nestling in the hills, near the Rhéne River, just south of
Lyon, is the Cornas vineyard—a most satisfying example
of red wine. Clape.

GIGONDAS 1970 4.49 48.50
Gigondas is a superior example of red Rhéne wine—the
very wine featured at the Hostelerie de Beaumaniére at
Les Baux. Caves St. Pierre.

Si, JOSHPH 1969 2 os 4.79 51.75
One bank of the Rhéne River produces Hermitage—the
opposite bank produces St. Joseph. The grape varieties
and taste qualities are similar, although the Hermitage
generally reaches more exalted heights. Estate-bottled,
Florentin.

CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1970 oS 6255
There is an eagle’s nest vineyard towering over the town
of Chateauneuf-du-Pape which is called Domaine de
Beaucastel. It is at this vineyard that this glorious ex-
ample of an outstandingly fine red Rhone Valley wine is
estate-bottled. It is now in balance, and you will be de-

‘ lighted with it.

COTE ROTVIE1970 2... 3... 5.99 64.70
Produced at a celebrated vineyard only a five minute
drive south of the famed Pyramide Restaurant in Vienne.
The incredibly steep vineyard faces due south, held up
by sturdy retaining walls, and everything must be culti-
vated by hand. Deep in color, full-bodied, amazingly
long life, and everyone looks for the aroma of violets
when they drink ‘Céte Rétie.’ Estate-bottled, Domaine
Devieux.

HERMIPAGE 1969) ck es os ak os ce 6.99 75.50
Estate-bottled, Domaine Jallade. The vineyard is ‘pure
rock’ and faces due south. George Saintsbury described
it as the ‘‘manliest wine” he has ever drank.
