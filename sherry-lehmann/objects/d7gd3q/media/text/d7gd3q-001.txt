We can think of no pleasanter way to launch
your Summer drinking, than to alert you to our
favorite wines and spirits—those bottles in
our cellars that we consider to be outstand-
ing, not only for their taste but for their low
prices as well

Summer is the time for carefree fun and
leisure. Whether you are Summering in the
City—or on Long Island (in the Hamptons or
out to Montauk)—or along the Hudson Valley,
we offer you prompt and free delivery on any
order over $30. Take advantage of our con
venient, reliable services during the leisurely
warm-weather months ahead.

So phone us—or drop into our shop— or
simply fill out the convenient order form. It’s
surprisingly easy to LET OUR VALUES FOL
LOW YOU THIS SUMMER.
