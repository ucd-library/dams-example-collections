IN NEW YORK STATE?

If so, let the wine and spirit values that you see in this brochure
follow you. Distance from Manhattan should not deny you the
privilege of entertaining your friends in your mountain retreat or
beach house with satisfying, creative examples of the world of
wines and spirits. The economics will also work in your favor
because you will surely find that our prices will be lower—the
selection more complete—and there is no charge for prompt de-
livery on any order over $30 from Montauk Point to Duchess
County. We will deliver wherever you are, whether it be by our

AO own truck, United Parcel Service, or a reliable transportation
cs

‘ i, service. Let us play a part in making your summer as pleasurable
