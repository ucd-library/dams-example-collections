Unlocking the Best of Sonoma

Dr. Elias Hanna, recognized world wide for his
cardiac surgery skills, loved his medical practice in
bustling downtown San Francisco, yet yearned for
the relaxed pace of farm life in his native Syria. In
the 1970s he realized his dream with the purchase
of 12 acres in the Russian River Valley. This simple
beginning led to great achievements and today
Christine, Dr. Hanna’s eldest daughter, maintains
the high standards of quality that her father
established.

Hanna Winery unlocks the essence of Sonoma
County and continually focuses on making great
wine even better. Hanna produces impressive j on
wines from 100% estate grown fruit from three
diverse locations - the Russian River Valley,

Alexander Valley and Mayacamas Mountains.

2002 Bordeaux Futures

At the risk of sounding redundant, Bordeaux pulled off a miraculous feat

for the third straight year. The early part of vintage 2002 gave a scare to the

Bordelais with its cool and rainy weather, but a beautiful August, a stunningly
dry September, and a very warm and clear October caused a dramatic turn of
events for the Chateaux. This tremendous string of great weather literally saved

ano made the vintage. —
