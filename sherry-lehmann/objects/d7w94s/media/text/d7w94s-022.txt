1996 RED BORDEAUX

Robert Parker comments: “The vintage is extreme-

 

ly abundant, although selections at the top estates
were severe. The obvious strength of the 1996
vintage, which has been apparent from the first
tastings in cask, has been the Medoc’s Cabernet
Sauvignon... When tasted side by side with the top
1995 Medocs, most of 1996's si wperstars are wines
with more significant length, richness and
completeness in the mouth."
