Did you ever wonder what kind of wine someone like Baron
Eric de Rothschild, proprietor of Chateau Lafite Rothschild, likes to
consume on a daily basis? Look no further! This
traditional red is a classic blend of Cabernet
Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, which
is selected from declassified grapes used in
the blending of all the Domaines Barons de
Rothschild wines from the Medoc. Produced
under the skilled guidance of Charles
Chevalier, the master winemaker at Lafite,
it is a delicious claret with a special emphasis
on the Merlot grape

  

  

  

  

This 2001 Medoc is a particular favorite of Baron
Eric de Rothschild, an avid hunter, who enjoys
serving this wine to friends at dinners hosted at
KA. his favorite hunting lodges. Ripe berry fruit with
Y mouthfilling flavors and soft, balanced tannins
make this an outstanding value in red Bordeaux
excellence. (982)

Two Great Champagnes From

ae lWIUWVUVL& ce

MUMM DE CRAMANT

Mumm de Cramant is a wonderful, very unique boutique
Champagne made exclusively from Chardonnay grapes from a
single, 100% rated, grand cru vineyard in the highly prized village
of Cramant. Comprised from a single vintage, the grapes for
this graceful, single-cru cuvee reflect the diversity and richness
of the Cramant terroir. As

it is released at optimum

vibrancy in its youth - instead

of the 36 months of aging

required by law for a

vintage-dated Champagnes

- the Mumm de Cramant

cannot be labeled as a

vintage Champagne.

First bottled in 1882, Mumm

de Cramant was exclusively

reserved for directors and

special friends of the House

of Mumm. Under the

watchful eye of chef

de caves, Dominique

Demarville, Mumm de

Cramant is still crafted with

the same exceptional care.

M. Demarville creates a

cuvee that reflects Mumm’s superior quality and pays homage to
Champagne’s prestigious Cramant vineyard. It is an elegant and
graceful Champagne that is simply delicious.” (78)

MUMM CORDON ROUGE BRUT

Mumm’s Cordon Rouge Brut is a
true Champagne classic that is proudly
featured in the Raoul Dufy water-
color depicted on the cover of this
catalogue! In the late 19th century,
Mumm place a red ribbon on its label
as a tribute to the Legion d’Honneur.
This red ribbon has since become
synonymous with Mumm and
Champagne excellence! “A most
distinctive Champagne with an extra
dimension that makes it stand out
from the pack. It offers pungent
earthy, toasty aromas that melt on the
palate in opulent, creamy flavors that
linger with richness on the finish.”
—Wine Spectator (62)

hateau de La Chaize, built in 1676, is located in the heart of
Beaujolais and is the star among the wine estates of Brouilly. La
ws Marquise Nicole de Roussy de Sales inherited the Chateau in 1967.
At that time there were 14 vigneron families living on the property,
some of whose roots date back to the founding of the Chateau by
Pere de La Chaize, confessor to Louis XIV! Through hard work, the
Roussy de Sales family transformed this “sleeping beauty” into the most
successful wine estate in Brouilly. Chateau de
La Chaize is a remarkable wine that displays
delicious, berry-like flavors and great
elegance. It is renowned for its enormous
body and long, lingering flavors. It is truly
in a league of its own. (990)

his new Riesling comes to us from the highly regarded
Pfalz cellars of Dr. Burklin-Wolf, affectionally referred to
as simply “The Doctor.” Crafted to be full-bodied with
vibrant fruit, the mineral-laden Riesling is dry in style. This 2002
Riesling displays great richness and balance with good density,
ripe fruit, spice notes and bracing acidity.

  

In a recent article entitled “Second to One,” the Wine
Spectator comments: “Germany's 2002 Rieslings are out-
standing follow-ups to the magnificent 2001s...Germany
enjoyed a fine crop of ripe, healthy Riesling in 2002.
Although it may always remain in the shadow of its
predecessor, 2002 stands on its own as an excellent vintage.
This is great news for German Riesling lovers. With the 2001s
selling briskly or, in many cases, already sold out, the 2002s

 
 

come to the rescue at a time when estate German Riesling is SARS
enjoying a resurgence in popularity, winning new fans with ABurklin- Wolf
every quaff.” (694)
