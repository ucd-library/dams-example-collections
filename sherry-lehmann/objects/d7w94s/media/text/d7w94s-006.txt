_ taham Beck was born in Cape Town and his success as an entrepreneur began while studying
y commerce at the University of Cape Town. During this time he established a successful home-
renovation business call “Kangra.” Graham Beck then ventured into the coal mining business
where he once again achieved numerous successes. His business interests are global and Graham’s

love of horses and wine led to other successful operations throughout the world.

Graham Beck Wines is now entering its third generation as a family winery. Established in 1983
when Graham Beck purchased Madeba farm outside the Western Cape town of Robertson. Graham
Beck had a fervent ambition to establish a world-class winery in this region. The success of the
Robertson winery has been extended to the second Graham Beck cellar in Franschhoek, one

of the oldest winemaking regions in South Africa. “Making good wine is admirable. We want to
produce great wine. Wine that will make South Africa proud, comments Graham Beck. The three

wines listed here are ample testimony to Graham Beck’s devotion to excellence.
