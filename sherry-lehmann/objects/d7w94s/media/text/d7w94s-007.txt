From The Heart of Napa Valley

Dominus &
Napanook

Dominus Estate is the Napa Valley
property of Christian Moueix of Chateau
Petrus. Produced from the historic
Napanook Vineyard, Dominus is a
Bordeaux-inspired blend of Cabernet
Sauvignon with small amounts of Merlot,
Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.
Established in 1866, Napanook was one
of the first vineyards planted and named in
the heart of the valley and has long been recognized for its extraordinary fruit.
It is the original ranch where George Yount planted the first vines of the
Napa Valley. More recently, it was one of the three vineyards from which the
great vintages of Inglenook were made.

The first Dominus was produced in 1983 and quickly obtained worldwide
recognition for its opulence, spiciness and rich fruit. Although native to
California, it clearly has a French touch with its emphasis on
elegance and refinement. Dominus is made from the sloping
vineyards that abut the Mayacamas
Mountains. Napanook, produced since
1996 with grapes coming from different
blocks of the vineyard, reflects the idea of
immediate pleasure in a young, drinking

 

wine.
