“Whether making movies or making wine, Francis Ford
Coppola aims for the stars,” comments Wine Spectator.
Francis Ford Coppola has been making movies for over
40 years, and wines at his Niebaum-Coppola Estate
Winery in the Napa Valley for almost 25. Always a vision-
ary, Mr. Coppola was intrigued by the Bordeaux-inspired
blends and had a dream of not just creating a Cabernet
Sauvignon but a proprietary red. “Rubicon” refers to
the Italian river that denotes the point beyond which
there is not turning back. Equally intriguing Is
“Blancaneaux” - a world-class proprietary white
| that makes a worthy partner to “Rubicon.”

  

“Possesses more new oak along with Impressive
richness, and notes of cedar, smoke, black currants,
and meaty/forest floor characteristics...It will
provide delicious drinking now and over the next
decade.” - Robert Parker (91305)

Literally meaning “white water” in French,
Blancaneaux Is a blend of Chardonnay, Viognier,
Marsanne, and Roussanne and Is made from grapes
' grown entirely on the Niebaum-Coppola Estate In
Rutherford. Citrus dominate, Blancaneaux’s initial
flavors Of pear and peach lead to great complexity
and considerable depth. (92246)

familiar with the renowned white wines of

supreme. But other fine, white grape varietals find their
ultimate expression in the vineyards of Alsace. Bordered
by the Vosges Mountains, Alsace is home to Pinot
Blanc, Pinot Gris, Riesling and Gewurztraminer. Alsace
producers seek bone dry, firm and flavorful wines to
match their region’s renowned cuisine.

 

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
  

Among the finest of all producers is the venerable
House of Trimbach, established in 1626, which has
been rated globally as one of the greatest names of
Alsace. Today, Hubert and Bernard Trimbach are
at the helm, ably assisted by Bernard’s sons, Pierre
and Jean. The Trimbach family supervises every
single aspect of their operation, from planting and
vinification to selection and bottling. The balance
and harmony that these wines achieve year in and
year out make them ample competition to any of
the great, dry white wines of the world.

Vina Haras “Elegance”

FROM CHILE’S THOROUGHBRED WINE ESTATE

       

In 1991, after a highly successful busi-
ness career in Chile’s private sector,
entrepreneur Eduardo Matte acquired
an estate that he would later name
Haras de Pirque, in the southwestern
part of Pirque, a prestigious wine-
growing area situated in the Maipo
valley. Eduardo Matte’s objectives
included launching a major winery
project, and expanding his existing,
well-regarded thoroughbred breeding
farm.

    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
      
   
   
    
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
    
 
 
    
 
   
   
   
 
    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
   
 
      
 
     
 
   
   
 
    

Today the property consists of 600 hectares that gently ascend the
lower slopes of a spur of the Andes Mountains and have been
planted with prime rootstock of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot,
Carmenere, Chardonnay
and Sauvignon Blanc. Haras
de Pirque’s name honors
the country’s oldest
thoroughbred breeding
farm which is a prominent
supplier for breeders and
owners in both South and
North America. Both wines
and horses are winners!

  

Vina Haras de Pirque
features a uniquely
designed, horseshoe-shaped winery, pictured above, the
only one of its kind in the world. Built on the side of a hill,
it is a tribute to both the estate’s vineyards and its
thoroughbred farm. Vina Haras de Pirque’s primary
objective is to offer superior quality, original wines
for the most demanding segment of the world
market. The stars of the Vina Haras cellars are the
two Elegance Selections
shown here. Both wines
represent outstanding
quality.
