he firm of Antonin Rodet has been one of Burgundy’s world renowned sources for
outstanding wines for over 20 years. Burgundy-lovers have long enjoyed the wines they
produce from their estates in the Cote Chalonnaise, Cote de Beaune and Cote de Nuits.
Their exceptional skill in viticulture, vinification and aging of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay
led them to look for an adventure outside of Burgundy.

 

 
 
  

After a long and meticulous search they chose the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains

in the Languedoc. Here they found all the assets needed to make great wine:

rich, sloping land, good quality clay and limestone soil; and ideal climatic Rodet
conditions due to the high altitude. Their goal is to produce the greatest
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay outside of Burgundy. After sampling the
wines below, we're sure you'll agree with their wise choice.

Veramonte is the largest contiguous

vineyard in Chile and stretches over

350 hectares in the prime growing area
of Chile’s Casablanca Valley. In 1990, Agustin Huneeus
chose this site for Veramonte recognizing that the micro-
climates and soils of this beautiful valley are similar to
California’s prestigious Napa Valley and Carneros wine-
growing regions. A native Chilean, Agustin Huneeus joined
Napa Valley based Franciscan Estates in 1985 as President
and CEO, bringing with him international wine experience
from Chile and the United States.

Veramonte was first introduced in 1996, and it has
since earned international critical acclaim for the quality of
its wines. The winery is a state-of-the-art, modern wine-
making facility designed by one of Chile’s foremost leading
architects, Jorge Swinburn. It includes the latest technology
in bottling lines, gravity-fed fermentors and ultra-modern
stainless steel tanks. It is also designed for small-lot
winemaking, allowing separate fermentation and aging of
individual vineyard blocks and experimental vineyard
plots. Its no wonder the wines listed here have become
so popular among discriminating wine-lovers.
